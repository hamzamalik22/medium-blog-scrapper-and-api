Por desgracia, distintos factores han motivado que la seguridad haya escalado posiciones en la planificación de cualquier evento navideño. Londres ha ido un paso más allá y ha diseñado un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial para identificar a cualquier posible sospechoso que se adentre en el centro de la ciudad. ¿Una medida necesaria o excesiva? El debate está servido. La Policía londinense desarrollará durante la Navidad una campaña de reconocimiento facial que tendrá dos líneas de actuación. En primer lugar, se creará un amplio fichero con los rostros de aquellos transeúntes que deseen participar en el programa. Para ello, agentes policiales debidamente identificados solicitarán a los ciudadanos que se dejen escanear el rostro. De este modo, los británicos contribuirán a agilizar el trabajo de la Policía a la hora de controlar grandes masas de personas. La segunda parte de la campaña consistirá en la instalación de cámaras de vídeo con la tecnología de reconocimiento facial integrada. Hasta aquí, las ventajas de la campaña son evidentes. Los agentes de Policía que están trabajando desde los diferentes centros de control pueden seguir en tiempo real la situación de las calles londinenses y, cuando aparezca un sospechoso, el sistema de reconocimiento facial activará la alarma pertinente. Conviene recordar que Reino Unido ha sufrido varios atentados terroristas de carácter islamista en los últimos años, al tiempo que el inminenteBrexitha generado una mayor sensación de inseguridad entre buena parte de la población. Con todo, tan invasivo protocolo de vigilancia no ha gustado a todos. La organización Big Brother Watch ha calificado el nuevo operativo policial londinense como “autoritario, peligroso e ilegal”. Autoritario porque supone ceder a las autoridades la potestad de reconocernos en cualquier situación y sin que medie una orden judicial (en principio, de manera voluntaria). Peligroso porque una cesión de ese calibre puede volverse en nuestra contra si alguien lograhackearel sistema de vigilancia. Ilegal porque, salvo que se modifique la legislación vigente (y no está previsto un movimiento en este sentido, no es lícito grabar a los transeúntes de manera indiscriminada. Por ahora, los policías de Londres sortean este último obstáculo con la petición formal a los ciudadanos para que colaboren con el operativo. La seguridad es una de nuestras grandes preocupaciones y en este espacio te comentaremos qué papel puede jugar la tecnología.

https://virtualrealitypop.com/the-2018-vr-ar-tier-list-1cfd4bbe9fe2?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,The 2018 VR/AR Tier List,A-TIER DISCUSSION,"Khoi Le Follow Virtual Reality Pop -- Listen Share Ranking the VR/AR industry across the board Most videogames with differentiated characters have atier list. It’s a ranking of which characters are the best in the game due to their special abilities or stats. Here is the 2018 tier list for the VR/AR industry. A-Tier — Actual contenders Sony PSVR Oculus Go HTC Vive/Vive Pro Oculus Rift B-Tier — Things that exist but don’t really exist HTC Vive Focus Windows Mixed Reality Google Lenovo Mirage Solo A-TIER DISCUSSION Having PSVR as number one may be a little controversial, as PSVR is solely focused on gaming, and most people believe that VR extends beyond gaming. However, there is no denying the success of PSVR. In August, Sony officially announcedthree million PSVR units sold(over $1B in revenue). Super Data estimates1.3M PSVR units sold in 2018alone. On top of clear sales numbers, 2018 PSVR has phenomenal exclusives likeAstro Bot: Rescue Mission,while delivering industry breadwinners likeBeat Saber. Currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers Currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers In retort to the“but VR isn’t about gaming!”statement,it’s become increasingly clear that currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers (own high-end hardware, play alone + online, spend > $30 for killer content). So much so that Oculus has begun to call the Quest (standalone headset coming out 2019) the “Nintendo Switch” of VR AND brought Aaron Davies back to head up gaming content. Moreover, Oculus’s promoted titles and million dollar funded content (seeMarvel: Powers United) have, to my knowledge, all been games. Clearly, Facebook/Oculus have committed to the fact that games are the near-future consumer power play. Just look at the way VR controllers are designed. VR controllers scream “use me to play games!” Number two for 2018 is the Oculus Go. Released in May, the Oculus Go was touted as accessible VR for anyone. No PCs, no wires, no phones, all for $199. My little brother could bring VR to a retirement home in a village in the Spanish mountains,my students could build VR appson their own laptops, andWalmart could train over a million employees. This was an incredible step forward for the industry. Super Data estimates Oculus Go sales clocking in at 1.1M units, and even realistOculus CTO John Carmack was impressedwith Oculus Go sales. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Oh the perennial Rift vs. Vive square off. CES 2018 saw the announcement of theVive Pro: higher resolution, built-in headphones, adjustable housing for glasses/lashes*, and a wireless adapter to go tetherless. It sounds like the Vive Pro is perfect for…VR arcades. I put Vive above the Rift on the tier list simply due to the fact that LBE-VR (location-based entertainment) is largely Vive-centric, IMO due to Vive’s larger tracking space capabilities. Arcades and LBE easily outpace home usage of VR, which puts Vive ahead of Rift for consumers. *As an aside, I absolutely hate that Oculus Rift was designed seemingly exclusively for people with large, protruding noses (Oculus is an American company). As someone with a flat nose, a huge amount of light leaks into the Rift when I use it. Meanwhile HTC, a Taiwanese company, has clever nose flaps on the Vive that block out light if your nose is flat and pull back if your nose protrudes. Please design products for people of all shapes. If you think arcades are NOT consumer VR, then I would put Rift ahead of Vive. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Rift also pulled slightly ahead in Steam market share this year. I just think in-home PC-VR is still a very small market. If you’re an Oculus fan, don’t worry about Rift being the bottom of the A-tier. Oculus has clearly shifted its focus away from PC-VR, even supposedlycancelling the Rift 2. The Oculus Quest will be an interesting contender next year. Going into 2019, I think games will become the pivotal point for consumer VR headset adoption.Rumors of Nintendo Switch’s “test VR-mode” make me curious about Nintendo potentially making a play in the space. As we know from Pokémon Go and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Nintendo’s IP makes huge PR ripples and convinces people to spend money. As standalone 6-DOF VR with 6-DOF controllers hit the market, look to see this list completely upended next year. B-TIER DISCUSSION A quick discussion about the B-tier. These are B-tier due tovery few units sold and a lack of content. HTC Vive Focus was the first standalone 6-DOF VR HMD to release to consumers. BUT it was only in China, and there were no 6-DOF controllers. There are very limited use cases in which having 6 degrees of freedom is useful without 6-DOF hand-tracking — in fact, the only one I can think of is 3D asset viewing (and even that benefits from having tracked hands). I’ll throw the Lenovo Mirage Solo into this boat as well and say that this leads to a very confused purpose. Developers aren’t sure what to build for the platform, and consumers aren’t sure what to use the platform for. It’s a sad limbo between Oculus Go, which can achieve standalone 360-video viewing and basic interactive experiences, and the Rift/Vive, which have full VR capabilities. Thus, no content. Be on the lookout, however, as the Vive Focus makes its way intoChinese classroomsandWestern enterprises. Vive also announced the coming of 6-DOF controllers, and Google already has devkits out. Whether or not the Focus can rival the upcoming Oculus Quest is a different matter, as the Quest will have similar specs at a lower price point. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are… I don’t even know. They are super cheap, require no set up, and work on most Windows machines. However, I think this is also a content issue for now. There is also a lack of support from Microsoft to really market and push these headsets, especially towards developers. Even though they gave me a free headset and brought me in for a multi-day build-a-thon, I never ended up shipping my game for Windows MR due to development barriers. I can see the Vive Focus and Google Lenovo Mirage Solo both making a play next year once they have their6-DOF controllers. Windows MR will require a huge play from Microsoft to survive. A-Tier — Large clients signed Microsoft HoloLens STRIVR(disclaimer, I worked here for two summers) Scope AR Taqtile B-Tier — Sleeper companies (watch for deals and growth in 2019) Mira Reality Mursion Meta I’m not that familiar with the smart glasses space, so the companies above use headsets capable of tracking and 3D renderings. I acknowledge the fact that Google Glass and companies like DAQRI and Vuzix are contenders in the enterprise space. A-TIER DISCUSSION I believe that enterprise contenders mark their spot on this list by signing large deals. This year,HoloLenssigned a$480M dealwith the United States Army*. HoloLens also powers the solutions used by #3 and #4 companies Scope AR and Taqtile. Moreover, Microsoft is backing the future of HoloLens,creating a HoloLens 2.0. As a “standalone holographic computer,” the HoloLens is a powerful unit with just enough capabilities for enterprise training needs. Aside from signing a $480M deal with a huge client with potential for future horizontal scaling, controlling the hardware is what makes HoloLens the #1 for 2018. *Side note, I feel ethically uncomfortable with AR being used to enhance activate combatants’ ability to kill. I acknowledge that, arguably, AR will also enhance their safety. STRIVRsigned a massive deal with Walmart this year. EVERY single one of Walmart’s (nearly 5,000) stores will have STRIVR in it.Almost 17,000 Oculus Go’s will be used to train Walmart employees.STRIVR’s other clients include Verizon, jetBlue, and Chipotle. STRIVR’s software is rapidly becoming a robust product suite, and its team is quickly growing. During a meeting at STRIVR this year, a potential software partner gawked in awe and told me, “I’ve never seen a VR startup this big.” Scope ARlock(he)ed in a deal withLockheed Martin Space(halving onboarding times) andTaqtileworked with theKing County Water Treatment. B-TIER DISCUSSION Mira Reality’s key advantage is the fact that they have a smartphone-based solution rather than the HoloLens. Why are smartphones better? Smartphones are easy-to-secure devices, secured by standard enterprise security software installations. HoloLenses need to be uniquely onboarded onto enterprise Wi-Fi in a secure fashion, which is costly (time and money). I’m concerned for Mira’s moat, as it seems like other companies can easily replicate. Mursionis focused on interpersonal skills, which is a unique niche that has a good market of existing L&D products. Mursion uniquely employs actors to remotely engage with trainees through virtual avatars. Actors make compelling behavioral realism, but are expensive to scale. Metais hanging in there, but seems to befloundering. I hope it holds on, since Meron Gribetz has a good vision. This doesn’t even deserve a list. Consumer AR HMDs are non-existent. But alright, let’s talk about potential contenders. A-Tier — Good showing this year Magic Leap B-Tier — Keep an eye on Apple Avegant A-TIER DISCUSSION Based on 2018’s showing,Magic Leapis the only potential contender to become a consumer AR headset in the next 5 years. I think the HoloLens is not going to be a player in the consumer space and is clearly making moves towards enterprise use cases. Similarly, Meta has also staked its position as an enterprise play (it’s tethered to a high-end PC for crying out loud), evendenouncing consumer use cases. Magic Leap has set up partnerships and positioned itself as a consumer content focused device. As the price point decreases, the form factor slims, and the experience improves, Magic Leap will easily claim this space. Experiences already include: games likeSeedlingandLuna: Moondust GardenandDr. Grordbort’s Invaders, streaming/news services likeCheddarandNYT AR, and music experiences like Sigur Ros’sTonandi. B-TIER DISCUSSION This is a 2018 list. I only putApplein the B-tier because they have not officially announced an AR headset…yet. As soon as Apple announces their AR headset, which is rumored to be in the next two years, Magic Leap will have to fight very hard to get into the hands of consumers. I truly believe Apple will be the first large tech company who can take a crack at AR for the mass consumer. But it’s a 2018 list, so they’ve got to be in the B-tier. Aveganthas no public product yet. However, I believe the company has the foundation for a strong AR headset play (or acquisition play) in the next 10 years. Avegant has excellent technologists building lightfield displays (light enters your eye as if it were bouncing off a real object). They also have experience with and a good relationship with hardware production lines. A-Tier — Real usage Snapchat Houzz B-Tier — Sleeper companies to look out for Torch AR Wonderscope A-TIER DISCUSSION I don’t care about all the mobile AR games out there.Snapchathas over 70 million users use AR EVERY day. Snapchat Lenses, filters developed by third parties, are the first look at the large-scale distribution of AR content created by artists and developers. No need to download an app, just open Snapchat. I would say that Snap is the largest distributor of AR content in the world. Snap has introduced the masses to the concept of digital objects (filters and dancing hot dogs) overlaid on top of the real world. I strongly believe that the camera will soon become a platform, and Snapchat currently owns that space for a huge number of users, albeit in a specific demographic. Houzz’s new feature, View in My Room, released in May, is an AR feature where one can preview a piece of furniture at scale in their house. Over 2 million shoppers have used View My Room in the Houzz app. That’s huge. I don’t count Pokemon GO because it is questionably AR and wasn’t released this year. However, it’s still going strong! B-TIER DISCUSSION To be honest, I didn’t try that many mobile AR titles this year. If you’re interested in mobile AR titles, definitely check outarcritic.com. Torch ARis a fantastic application that delivers real value. Torch intends to deliver simplistic prototyping tools for UX designers creating mobile AR apps. Drag and drop assets from Sketchfab and Poly into the world to easily set up a scene, link them with various interactions, then click through your medium fidelity prototype. I am eager to see their growth in 2019, especially under the fantastic vision of Paul Reynolds, whom I was lucky enough to speak with earlier this year. Paul showed me live realtime video integrations with Torch, demonstrated Torch’s complex interaction systems capabilities, and painted Torch’s future as the “InVision” of AR. Early in 2018, I built the first AR short film,Snowbird, with my friend Max Korman. Through building and shipping Snowbird, I established several predictions. Immersive storytelling in AR would be very compelling Kids were the primary target because they would be willing to deal with tracking issues, enjoy a story no matter how low-poly the animation was, be willing to walk around and explore, and have time to enjoy whimsical cartoons (vice versa, Katie Hughes ofBeast Pets VRsays they made baby dragons instead of adult ones because people have lower expectations of baby animals). AR story distribution would not happen via the App/Play Store. No one would download an app every time they wanted to watch a few-minute-long AR story. Platforms that have lots of stories available, likeWithin, would need to exist in the AR space soon. Well, I was right on all four. So right, in fact, thatWithinitself made an AR story platform for kids:Wonderscope.Wonderscope is a well-crafted application that brings AR stories to kids. It combines a wonderful 2D interactive narrative through a great mascot with augmented reality and voice interaction that encourages reading. Currently with three stories, Wonderscope will become a platform for AR short stories geared towards children, though I seeWithinlaunching more mature stories soon. My first impressions of the stories were that they were quite gimmicky and haven’t fully leveraged the AR medium yet, but it’s only a matter of time until they figure it out. Already, the user experience of “finding a landing place” for the AR story helicopter is a fantastic way to get users to scan their environment. ARKit 2 ARCore 8th Wall Ubiquity 6 6D.ai ARKit 2, Apple’s native AR SDK, has a wealth of features that make it incredibly powerful right now. Firstly, the baseline tracking is superb because Apple has full control and access to the hardware. ARKit 2 has persistence, multiuser, 2D image recognition and movement tracking, 3D object scanning and recognition, and most importantly: Quick Look. Quick Look will enable native Apple apps like Safari and Mail to preview .uszd files in AR. Apple even claims you’ll be able to see reflections of real surroundings in shiny objects! ARCoreis the Android equivalent to ARKit. ARCore has some great features, including cross-platform capability for shared experiences, meaning an Android user and an iOS user can simultaneously, locally view the same AR experience. ARCore has to deal with a variety of different hardware devices due to the variability of Android phones in the wild. 8th Wallis an SDK that utilizes ARCore on compatible Androids, ARKit on compatible iOS devices, and uses its own algorithms on other devices. Plainly stated, it is trying to bring AR to every device. 8th Wall’s killer feature is web AR, augmented reality that works in your mobile browser. Yes. Go tointothespiderverse-ar.comright now to check it out. Ubiquity 6has an all-star team backed by all-starfunders. They are another SDK working on killer computer vision solutions for mixed reality. They did an exhibition at the SF MOMA earlier this year with over 100 people leaving persistent artifacts in augmented reality. 6D.aiis built on solid tech (I believe from Oxford) and good leadership under Matt Miesnieks. Their distinctive feature is occlusion. They also have fantastic physics based on real-time world meshing. The goal for 6D.ai is to crowdsource a 3D mesh of the world, which will be huge. They also have Cymatic Bruce ❤ Full disclaimer, I don’t try as much VR/AR content as I should. As a student, it’s really hard to find time to put on the headset. I don’t play many VR games anymore, so I’m sorry to all the other 2018 releases that didn’t make the cut. If you’re curious about the other games, I takeJesse Damiani’s opinion of the top 25 gamesvery seriously. I didn’t get a chance to try SPHERES, Pixel Ripped, or Stormlands, all of which were large titles this year. A-Tier — Fantastic Titles Beat Saber and Where Thoughts Go (they’re so different, yet equally good) Virtual Virtual Reality Crow: The Legend B-Tier —Experiences with missed potential TendAR BOT-NET Beat Saberjust absolutely crushed it by being insanely fun. ‘Nuff said. There’s plenty of glowing (no pun intended) reviews out there. Beat Saber identified one fun mechanic in VR, slashing things with a light saber, and distilled it and amplified it to the MAX. Where Thoughts Gois a pure, refined, emotional piece that leaves you feeling vulnerable, healed, raw, and refreshed. Made by a team lead by Lucas Rizzotto and Darragh Dandurand, Where Thoughts Go is the first experiment that shows the potential of technology to bring people together. Disclaimer, I am now friends with Lucas and Darragh, they are brilliant, authentic, playful people. I look forward to seeing what they make next. Virtual Virtual Reality is whimsical and clinical, playful and dark, easy and challenging, and a whirlwind of fun. All of the interactions, stories, characters are ridiculous yet believable. In a world where humans now serve robots, you enter various virtual realities to fulfill the wishes of a plethora of demanding artificial intelligences. Arguably this was released on Daydream in 2017, but really who uses Daydream? Baobab’sInvasionwas the first VR content I ever tried, and I absolutely loved the colors, quirky characters, and fun animation style. Baobab quadruple delivered withCrow: The Legend. Crow: The Legend is a impeccably-crafted immersive narrative based on the Native American legend of the crow. Crow: The Legend is voiced by an all-star cast including CONSTANCE WU!!! Oprah, John Legend, Diego Luna, Liza Koshy and Tye Sheridan. I loved the colors, the environments, the lighting, the little animals and their quips. Baobab paces VR stories extremely well, leaving you in incredible environmentsjustlong enough to enjoy them while still being able to follow the story of Crow. What did the crow do? Watch it to find out. Okay, so Tender Claws crushed it with Virtual Virtual Reality. However, I was left wanting more from TendAR. TendAR is an experimental interactive app on your phone where you feed a virtual fish through your emotions. Smile at the feed-o-meter and your fish will eat “happy flakes” and become happy. But what if you’re having a bad day, will your fish comfort you? No, your fish will eat sad flakes and become sad as well, leaving you feeling guilty and probably even worse :( TendAR doesn’t really leverage spatial AR well. The fish allegedly swims around your world but there is no sense of depth besides how big your fish is. The tracking experience is poor and the UX related to your fish’s position in 3D space is similarly lacking and confusing. However, TendAR makes great use of effects for the face and emotions AR portion of the application. It’s a lot of fun to see the particles swirl around in realtime, adjusting to your emotions using Google’s emotion detection API. There is also an area where your fish has a fish tank and you can use coins to buy decorations. This seems pretty out of place, as these decorations don’t exist in the AR experience, as well as seeming very mobile-store-in-app-purchase-y. Overall, TendAR has great parts of an app — fun to make weird facial expressions, cool to see fish swim around real world, entertaining to see fish make weird facial expressions, relaxing to decorate fish tank — but lacks solid cohesion across the various stages, leading to a disjointed game loop. Disclaimer, I triedBOT-NETwhen it was released, but still early. I think they have new updates coming out with multiplayer. I just wasn’t super impressed with the AR affordances. Most of your real world is blocked out by a virtual landscape (okay it’s an AMAZING virtual landscape with excellent graphics and animations and particles), defeating the purpose of AR. However, let’s say this is more of a…hand-held VR experience that utilizes ARKit for tracking. Tracking is a little jumpy, so the movement in the game is a little rough. There’s also a joystick in the screen, so you don’t even have to move in real life, which confused me. Holding your phone up is tiring, holding up your phone AND using your thumbs to move and shoot is SUPER tiring. The narrative is unclear and the objective is equally unclear. The first 5 minute rule, where you need to hook the user in the first 5 minutes, was lost on BOT-NET’s design. It just plopped me in and had me start shooting stuff. However, I absolutely am floored by the graphics level achieved while using ARKit’s tracking. The animations and models in BOT-NET are very polished and put together, leading to a pretty immersive feel. Overall, the art team did a wonderful job, but the gameplay is a little flat. 2018 was a building year for VR/AR. We saw devs buckling down to create real value, powerful tools, next level narratives, and gloriously imaginative worlds. Next year will be what I call “the standalone standoff.” As the Vive Focus, Google Lenovo Mirage Solo, and Oculus Quest go head to head with 6-DOF standalone tracking and 6-DOF controllers, I expect big deals to be signed, crazy content to emerge, and valuable use cases to be identified.",Khoi Le,https://medium.com/@dragonkhoi/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--1cfd4bbe9fe2---------------------------------------,60,17 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*eqeIpJplHoX-6uzalg3sVg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*crc-OJeCCb2ZfKhPGnbEpg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*crc-OJeCCb2ZfKhPGnbEpg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*crc-OJeCCb2ZfKhPGnbEpg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eqeIpJplHoX-6uzalg3sVg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eqeIpJplHoX-6uzalg3sVg.jpeg,2019-01-02T19:40:23.468Z,Medium
https://medium.com/chingu/how-game-jams-are-an-amazing-way-to-learn-game-development-7b77fa56c252?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,How Game jams are an amazing way to learn game development,Where to find one?,"Parminder Singh Follow Chingu -- Listen Share So you have a lot of interest in game development but you have no team. Also where will you get an idea to build a game about? Game Jams! It is a contest where you get a theme in start and a deadline before which you need to finish and submit the game. It is like a hackathon but for game developers. Where to find one? There are always 10+ game jams running simultaneously onItch.io. So you can easily find one that fits your schedule. If you are very busy you can pick a weekend one like I did. How to get a team? One amazing thing about these game jams is that there are always Discord channels or Forums associated with each. Here you can post the type of work you want to do and you can team up with others that are finding you. It can be scary most of the times to ask out someone. But has it ever been easy? Think it this way, you are here to learn. You want to enter this contest so at end of it you know a thing or two more about game development than your current self. These jams are popular enough that you will surely find another newbie teammate. Can I do these solo? Yes, there have been game developers that are successful as solo devs. But personally I prefer working with a team. It divides the work and you finish faster. Speed is important in these jams. What if I fail my teammate? Keep this pressure, use this as a motivation that you want to prove yourself. There is a limit to your knowledge but you have to push it. Also your team should always decide a game idea that would not cause a lot of pressure. Keep a simple and enjoyable idea. Idea…? As a beginner your idea must be simple like a platformer, endless runner or a puzzle game. Mix in the game jam theme in it. e.g. if the theme is “hangover”, make an endless runner with an alcoholic man. If the theme is “sun”, make a platformer where the main character can drop a sun beam from above. In games, the best fun arises when you use something familiar to the players and add a twist to it. What tools to use? I usedUnity engineas it is very beginner friendly and you can easily search your errors. It uses C# for its code. Don’t worry if you don’t know C#, there are a lot of other solutions too likePhaser(JS),Godot(Python-like),Pygame(Python),Pico-8(Its own lang) and many more. You can choose the one that compliments your coding skills. For the art and music, there is no special need. Use whatever image editor or audio editor suits you. How does submission work in these? It depends on the organiser but there is mostly public voting. You put in your game files and create a eye catching page and description. You need the attention of people! So that you get more plays and you get more reviews. The players then rate your game on various factors like Art, Sound, Story, Innovation etc. At end of the judging period, your game is given some rank which you can brag about. The reviews show the ratings on each aspect so you can improve on those next time. This ends the motivation part :) This ends the motivation part :) I had bought aUnity courserecently and I started to follow it. Unity started to seem interesting and easy to work with. Now I wanted to build using it! I knew about game jams by then because I had made a game previously. It was very bad because I went the solo path. This time I wanted a teammate along with me! I have an online friend from Sweden that loves to make art. She had never worked on any game either so I asked if she could join in and she agreed. Her first question was an obvious one. But what will we build? But what will we build? I looked on itch.io’s game jam calendar.Christmas Game Jamlooked great! The exact theme was to be declared the next day. The themes I pre-planned were, A platformer where Santa defeats evil elves. An endless runner where Santa will dodge Grinch. An endless runner where Santa will drop gifts into houses. Now we waited, and on Saturday morning I open up the page and theme was “You’re on the naughty list”. I brainstormed for fifteen minutes and then came up with the following idea: An endless runner where Santa will drop gifts into houses that can have nice children and naughty children! An endless runner where Santa will drop gifts into houses that can have nice children and naughty children! With this idea in place we had the key elements of our game. We had to be fast as we had just two days! Every game needs some music, and I found some stock Christmas music that sounded good. Then I needed to make it turn on and off. I needed the settings on the main screen. We decided the game name will be… “Santa delivery”. At end of the first day, I learned to build a Game Manager singleton! It made everything very simple. It is like a store in Redux if you have a React background like me. Now, instead of making the game itself, we made the gameover screen instead. Then we called it a day. Next day we had to build the game! Here is the advantage of being in a team: while I am working on orienting a bunch of white squares on the screen and making them work, she was building the assets for Santa, houses and gifts. Asynchronous execution is beneficial if the Promises resolve. :) When the Santa was done, I had finished the gift dropping Meanwhile I also caused some “weird” bug. But at end, everything worked out. We submitted the project,Santa Delivery, on Christmas Eve! :) I evenpublished itto the Google Playstore for showing to my android friends in the future. Then I got the feedback from friends and family. They loved it! Meanwhile I also got comments on itch.io submission. And finally, we got the score and ranks! To conclude, if you are into game development, I highly recommend taking part in game jams. You’ll have something to show your next employer, you would get tons of ideas that you won’t make for the game jam but you can build those in the future.

Jeremy Nation Follow METACERT -- Listen Share Electrum develop SomberNight detailed thesophisticated phishing attackthat cost Electrum wallet users a grand total of nearly$1 million worth of bitcoin. It was December 21, 2018, just days before holiday celebrations, when Electrum developers received a screenshot that had been making the rounds in a German chat room. Depicted was an error message one user had received when sending a transaction, but something about the message wasn’t adding up to developers, since it directed users to what was discovered to be a malicious GitHub repository with a malware version of wallet. According to SomberNight the user who received this error message was likely using a legitimate Electrum client, but connected to a maliciously operated Electrum server when they attempted to broadcast a transaction. When the transaction couldn’t resolve, the client displayed the user the malicious error message, which directed them to install malware that would have prompt users to enter and subsequently steal any private keys. In order to increase their chances of intercepting transactions from clients the attacker created multiple servers in what is commonly referred to as a sybil attack. The rich text error message users who connected to the malicious servers received is a throwback to bitcoin dev code where it was used to report back errors to users like low incremental fee, missing inputs, or other issues could crop up. A Persistent Attacker Once the team caught wind of the attack a patch (3.3.2) was issued to the client but it was not a long term solution, as SomberNight explained: “This is not a true fix, but the more proper fix of using error codes would entail upgrading the whole federated server ecosystem out there…” Despite the team’s efforts, the patched iteration of their client later succumbed to the attacker again: Perhaps most troubling is the fact that users who had legitimate Electrum wallet clients were susceptible to the attack thanks to the mixture of maliciously plied code and sybil servers. Users who got the malware message received it inside the Electrum client, lending serious credibility to the attack. In addition,according to SomberNight, although Github indicated that the commit for the maliciously forked version of Electrum wallet had a verified signature, the binaries were certainly based on a modified source which defied decompiling. A Community Caught Off Guard The unfortunate situation makes an excellent case for projects to seek out MetaCert for verification of their resources, and for crypto-traders to subscribe to our anti-phishing browser plugin,Cryptonite, to keep them safe from phishing attacks. Simply put, if Electrum wallet users knew to look for MetaCert’s green shield of trust related to web resources, they would have thought twice about downloading the malware version of the wallet because the website’s shield would have remained black. If the shield is black Cryptonite users know better than to simply trust a web resource. Since the final link in the chain involves a phishing web resource, MetaCert’s early warning system is an effective deterrent to these types of attacks. Cryptonite’s shield only turns green for verified resources. As thousands of new phishing sites pop up every hour of every day, no matter how much they appear to be mimic the real deal, they can never receive a green shield from Cryptonite. A black shield means the site is unverified, and can’t necessarily be trusted.

As users cite “rejection discrimination” on mainstream platforms such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid, several reactionary right-wing independent dating apps have begun flooding the market promising to deliver on these lustful safe spaces. Just like their prefered politicians, however, the irony is incredibly rich. “This app is about love for conservatives by conservatives,” declared Righter founder Christy Edwards Lawton, the die-hard Trump supporter who spoke withVoxabout leftist hegemony over the market. “I think people should date who they want to date.

https://medium.com/@colin.gabriel.smith/killing-it-during-your-first-tech-interview-16ce13f9d0ce?source=tag_archive---------26-----------------------,How to be successful in your first tech interview,Written byColin Smith,"Colin Smith Follow -- 1 Listen Share Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. I remember I did alright but definitely failed one or two portions of it. I also did it completely over Skype which made the whole process way more painful. Definitely not a performance I can look back on and be proud of but it did land me my first internship. Back then, I had no idea what companies were looking for. I thought that finishing most of a problem would be enough. Or showing that I somewhat understood what the solution might be might get me through. I thought that was all I needed for a company to give me a chance. I was naive. Companies are taking a huge risk whenever they hire a new employee. You need to make sure that the company you are interviewing for will be excited to have you onboard. If you’ve achieved that, then you’ve nailed the interview. Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. First things first, highlight your strengths. What makes you a strong candidate? What will set you apart? I knew my background in teaching gave me a unique perspective and skill set. Regularly presenting in front of a lot of people allowed me to bring something extra to the table. And I’d much rather speak in front of an unimpressed software engineer over a group of pissed off teenagers any day. I made sure to take advantage of this skill during the interview. It especially became useful when chatting with the CEO of the small company I was interviewing for. I also had gone above and beyond on a website project I did for my degree program. The requirement was to have a basic HTML page with some JavaScript backing it. I decided to go the extra mile and to dive in and learn Angular and integrate it with my page. I am glad I did that because I got a new, fancy framework on my resume by taking on the extra work. On top of that, I got a great working of example of the shiny UI which was a great show piece. It showed that I was interested in new technologies and applying them to the work I did daily. It was also a great talking point during the interview. It gave me the chance to show that I could learn a new skill in a short amount of time and apply it meaningfully. You may find that you are stretching your resume to meet the requirements of a job. If you find yourself in this situation, then consider doing some open source work or applying for an internship. Both of these experiences will give you the valuable opportunity to contributed to a larger codebase. It also shows that you can collaborate with other people in a codebase. This is a skill most companies look for when hiring since it is vital for thriving in most modern tech companies. The second thing I would recommend is reading up on the company that you are applying for. What would a hiring committee for that company look for in a good candidate? Maybe some companies want a candidate that writes a lot of code quickly. They may want a quick learner that they can put on a project right away. Other companies may want a deep thinker that can plan out architecture and write comprehensive tests for code in production. It all depends on the kinds of projects that the company is working on. Sending a rocket to Mars requires much different code and processes than sending a tweet. Sometimes employees and ex-employees at companies will list projects that they’ve been apart of on their LinkedIn. This can give you a better idea of what kind of skills and the type of employee the company values. You can also ask someone directly involved in the hiring process about the current projects the company is working on. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the company and the interview process itself. This is a two way street, and companies want to take on people that are excited to work for them. This can also lead to some insights on how the interview process will be structured. In general, I tend to ask if the interview will be more algorithms and data structures based or more domain knowledge based (in my case I ask if I can expect mostly questions around iOS). The last thing I recommend, is to practice. It sounds lame, but practicing with a friend in person does wonders for getting used to the interview environment. At first it might feel strange, but try to take it seriously. And always put on a timer for each question. You will have a limited amount of time to solve a problem during an interview, so getting used to tracking time is a good habit to get into. After you get the hang of solving questions on a computer, move on to a whiteboard. A lot of tech companies still force the use of whiteboards during interviews so having some practice with them can be helpful. Once you’re ready, go in with confidence. You can breath easy knowing that you’ve prepped and put some effort into getting ready. If you fail, no biggie. There are a ton of companies out there looking for candidates. You will have gained some knowledge on that particular company’s interview process. You will have also hopefully taken something away from the interview that you can go home and improve on. I’ve failed over 30 interviews in the past 4 years. We all fail. But as long as we’re picking ourselves up again and learning something from our failure, then we can treat each failure as a little badge of honor.",Colin Smith,https://medium.com/@colin.gabriel.smith?source=post_page---byline--16ce13f9d0ce---------------------------------------,95,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png,2019-01-08T04:15:59.599Z,Medium

You only need to issue the following commands and you're there: The problem with this approach is that Homebrew's OpenMPI formula is not versioned. Therefore, anytime you update/upgrade your Homebrew's formulae, then you'll get a new version. You can selectively upgrade the formulae you want, and stick to an OpenMPI version as long as you wish, but what if you want a specific version? you cannot do that. Developers using OpenMPI usually run their jobs in a High Performance Computing (HPC for short) cluster. These kinds of clusters are not upgraded as soon as someone releases a new OpenMPI version. It happened that the HPC cluster I work with is 2 or 3 versions behind the OpenMPI latest release. When administrators finally upgrade the version, then I need to tweak my local OpenMPI formula and point to an older version. That's not trivial. The only way to do that is looking at full commit history of thehomebrew-coreproject, identify the commit where the version has been upgraded, replace the local formula, and then deal with merge conflicts whenever you issuebrew update. In addition, the Homebrew's core formula does not contain a flag for enabling theSoftware-Based Performance Counters (SPCs). I created a custom Homebrew formula that could be of help for OpenMPI developers using macOS as their local environment of choice.

While some people may look at the word genomes and immediately think genetics there is a difference. According to WHO, “The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.” Identifying their combined influence is key in today’s scientific market. What doctors around the world are now learning pertains to the importance of ethnic diversity in clinical trial research. “Human genomic databases — collections of all the genetic information that has been sequenced over the years — are” heavily skewed to people of European descent, making it harder to correctly diagnose medical issues for non-Europeans. According to Scientific American, “The community has learned that there are far more of these larger, so-called structural variations than expected. These are now known to cause genetic disease and impact the way drugs are metabolized by individuals and ethnic populations.” Due to this revelation, there is now a push to include more minorities in clinical trials. The necessity of this is at an all time high as. An example of specific medical issues effecting a specific ethnic group can be seen in the Korean genome project which “found a population-specific variant in a gene that regulates how some medications are metabolized by the body; this is essential information for dosing and for gauging the likelihood that a patient will respond to a particular therapy.” The National Institutes of Health is currently pushing forward with an effort called “All of Us” which “aims to sequence a diverse sampling of Americans across gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and race. Being inclusive is an essential goal of this program, and participation is free so as to open the doors to anyone who wants to join.” Understanding more genomic data is essential to correctly diagnosing future medical issues and a must for minorities, who are underrepresented within these databases.",Jaymie White,https://medium.com/@supplierty?source=post_page---byline--d7bbdd0063d0---------------------------------------,1,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg,2019-01-02T18:34:39.088Z,Medium

Part 2,Written byInLinkUK,"InLinkUK Follow -- Listen Share In December we shared part 1 of this article, which discussed the current situation on high streets, and the role of technology in encouraging people into town centres. You can recap on our Medium page. Here, in part 2, Michelle Warbis considers how technology can facilitate increased consumer activity, before outlining InLinkUK’s contribution to reviving high streets. How can technology be harnessed to help — increasing economic activity Encouraging people to high streets is only half the story. Once people are on a high street, the value of their spend and activity, and its impact on local economic growth cannot be underestimated. The further use of technology on our high streets has an important part to play in increasing this much needed commercial activity. A study by staff at New York University, Future Cities Catapult and Center for Inclusive Growth, found that occurrences of on-street technology — specifically the Links deployed by LinkNYC in partnership with the City of New York — seemed to create uplift on surrounding commercial activity. The study notes that in areas of Brooklyn where Links have been deployed, there was an average uplift of 2.4% in retail transactional activity in surrounding businesses, something they note to be reasonably significant. The same study found that the presence of bike-sharing tech in Jersey City increased business in nearby food establishments by around 4%. Whilst more work is required in understand the reasons for this uplift, the statistics are encouraging. At InLinkUK, the cousin of LinkNYC, we’ve been trying new approaches to drive footfall into nearby businesses beyond standard advertising techniques. InLink Rewards is one of these approaches. With digital advertising on the large display screen publicising the scheme and the InLink Rewards platform hosted on the InLink’s tablet, consumers who interact with the InLink tablet can be sent mobile vouchers to be used in physical stores nearby. Not only does this type of ad-to-mobile drive overall spend, it enables businesses to steer consumers toward specific products in specific areas. TheGLA’s 2017 report on London’s Marketsoutlined the importance of innovation in sustaining and growing the capital’s markets, noting that they tend to lag behind other retail channels in terms of their uptake of technology, which in turn hinders long term revenue and profit. In this vein, the Mayor of Tower Hamlets has recently committed to providing free public Wi-Fi in the borough’s major public, civic and/or market places. This commitment is grounded not in a belief that shoppers require Wi-Fi, but that an internet connection istheenabler of market-stall card payments. In an increasingly cashless society, providing traders with a fast, secure, high quality connection could transform commercial activity in high streets’ markets. Not only will this make market shopping more appealing for more people and enable traders to more easily sell higher value items, it will also streamline practice, increasing speed of transaction and as such the number of transactions that occur. InLinks and high streets At InLinkUK, we are committed to improving high streets and town centres through the technology and telecoms services we provide through the roll out of InLinks in partnership with BT. However, we understand that technology is not a silver-bullet, and difficulties faced by the UK’s high streets and town centres are deep and multi-faceted, with legacy problems that need to be unpicked carefully and sensitively. InLinkUK is one part of this solution, with InLinks having direct and positive impacts on the digital, physical, economic and social systems that are integral to local places. Our ultrafast Wi-Fi is free to everyone, including market traders, work-at-homers, retail workers and community centres. Through our work to remove at least two existing BT payphones for each InLink installed we tidy up town centres, creating a better walking environment. Furthermore, our ongoing cleaning and maintenance of InLinks helps to keep high streets looking neat. As well as through our InLink Rewards scheme described previously, our partners programme offers discounted advertising rates to small businesses who are members of local business groups. We are continuing to look at ways the InLinks can further support local economic development. Complementing this, we champion social impact through content partnerships that showcase local and national charities, our InLink Local scheme that provides community groups with a place to advertise their events, and the tablet’s inclusion of charitable services supports people in getting the help they may need. Many commentators now say it istoo late for every high street, however a strategic effort — which InLinks are one part of — could go a long way in addressing the enduring challenges faced by high streets and town centres across the UK.",InLinkUK,https://medium.com/@InLinkUK?source=post_page---byline--5192451a7859---------------------------------------,3,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg,2019-01-03T13:31:00.829Z,Medium
https://medium.com/instant-sponsor/the-reality-of-real-time-sports-17b3679f0247?source=tag_archive---------80-----------------------,The Reality of Streaming Sports in Real Time,What Exactly Is Live-Streaming?,"Kathryn Kuchefski Follow Instant Sponsor -- Listen Share We have all been there, Live-Streaming Sunday Night’s big game from our computer or smartphone and BOOM…we receive a text from a friend or social media alert about the big play that just happened. The only problem is, we are watching on an online platform, and our feed is on a 30-second delay… this leads to major spoiler alerts. Ugh. These inherent delays cause viewers to shy away from watching the big game on their computer or smartphone. Not only does this latency lead to poor viewing quality, but also the potential loss of consumers viewing content and sponsorships associated with the big game. This past year, Limelight Networks did a series of surveys exploring consumer opinions, insights, and behaviors surrounding digital content. How do individuals feel about the inherent delays in “Live-Streamed” Sporting Events? And the amazing thing is59.3% of individuals globallystill subscribe to one or more Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD) service. Individuals want the ability to watch their favorite team play, no matter the time or the place. With the growth of social media, it is essential for media outlets to understand the needs and wants of these consumers. Would they be more likely to subscribe to an online platform such as Twitch, Facebook Watch, Reddit, etc. if latency issues were fixed? And the overwhelming answer was yes.59.5% of peoplesaid they would be more likely to watch live sports online if the streaming event had no delay from the live broadcast. And more than65% of individuals 26–45years of age would stream more sports online if the coverage was not delayed. What Exactly Is Live-Streaming? The idea behind live-streaming is that when someone is streaming a sporting event on their device, they are using LTE (Long-Term Evolution), WiFi and Bluetooth. Broadcasters will pick-up signals from their device — a phone — which is called the edge and then pass it along to another edge (phone). This is called Edge-to-Edge transfer — carrier to my phone. And all carriers will communicate differently. Limelight Networks has worked to address this challenge having recently launched Limelight Real-time Video Streaming. The company is claiming their new technology will allow for a sub-second live streaming platform which enables organizations to live stream video from around the world in less than a second. However, the jury is still out on the validity of this new technology. So, stay tuned for more. How Can Live-Streaming Enhance Their Entire Sports Marketplace? Regarding viewing live sports and eSports, the goal of any online streaming company is to make the viewing experience more interactive and therefore more social. Broadcasters could potentially start to communicate with fans during the game through social media and live streams depending on the platform — this has been done before but not in real time. Think of it like an Instagram influencer communicating with fans via Instagram Live. Such capabilities will enable further opportunities for streaming companies to monetize their live video content. 60% of viewerswould be more inclined to watch live sports online if they were streamed in real time. Distributors of live video and sports broadcasters need real-time live-streaming sub-second latency coverage to ensure an optimal viewing experience. The enhanced experience will not only increase viewership but also revenue. How Sponsorship will Play a Role With more eyeballs on the ‘big game’, sponsorship should become even sought after. At this moment in time, there is a surplus in sports sponsorship inventory (signage at games, jersey patches, etc). Between 30–50% of sponsorship inventory can go unsold in a given season, depending on the circumstances around the rights holder. Instant Sponsor aims to improve the rights holders ability to sell their inventory, and at the same time allow for a more diverse group of sponsors to enter the sports marketing ecosystem. With sponsorship’s value increased due to living streaming, more brands will be seeking to sponsor teams and athletes. Instant Sponsors platform breaks down the barriers of entry and allows for the parties to interact seamlessly on a peer-2-peer network.

https://medium.com/@WebserveBlogs/web-based-tech-support-a7931d1cee46?source=tag_archive---------187-----------------------,Web-based Tech Support,Written byWebserve Technology,"Webserve Technology Follow -- Listen Share Why You Must Invest in Web-based Tech Support Web-based tech supportis now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick, easy, time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base, here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it, the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Web-based tech supportis now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick, easy, time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base, here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it, the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Get Thoroughly Informative Content The first and a very crucial step towards developing a robustweb-based tech supportsystem is getting precise content in place for all the answers people may be seeking. Use your own experience in the business to put together a list of the commonest queries your customers may have and get some answers ready for the same. Be it through dedicated web pages for specific issues or through a page of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), invest in content that readily resolves concerns. Look at it as an investment that lets you save countless hours in having to respond individually to each customer. Troubleshooting Forms Just like the previous step of filing FAQs, this one would need you to come up with common complain points and create troubleshooting forms based on them. Make sure they are easy to understand and ask for only as much information as is necessary towards troubleshooting an issue. Too long and complicated forms are always a major turnoff for people. Live Chats Chats are an excellent replacement for phone calls. It makes it easy for consumers to make their complaints — they can contact the customer support team from anywhere at any time in situations where they cannot get on a call. And on the other side, chat also makes it easier for troubleshooting professionals to multi-task between various customers. So it’s a win-win. Should you want to go one step ahead and install a system that is available 24*7 for your customers, a chatbot can be a good idea. Many big and mid-sized companies now have AI-based chat support for their consumers and it’s fetching them good returns on investment. The Benefits of Web Based Customer Support Reduced Wait Times for Customers Call support is ridden by a massive issue of queue times for people — this holds especially true if you have a busy stream of support queries coming in every day. Many a time, wait times are so long that many people drop the call mid-way and complain about how poor the customer service of the company is. With web-based support, you can completely eliminate this problem. Customers can instantly get the static content on troubleshooting and write in to the chat support in case they need further assistance. Avoidance of Multiple Call Transfers For companies with various departments, the necessity to transfer a call from one department to another occurs often. This results in customers having to repeat the details of their problem over and over again to various executives, not to mention the frequent technical glitches involved in transferring calls. Online support helps get this straight by ensuring that the same set of information about a customer query is available to all and the customer only has to feed the information once. Better Record Keeping An extension of the last point, form or chat-based support allows for excellent record keeping of the complainant’s data. What the customer says once about the problem is saved in real time and can be accessed any time later for aiding in the troubleshooting process. On the other hand, recording phone calls and listening to them for assistance is nowhere as efficient as accessing written data. Customers Can Reach You from Anywhere in the World Making a call may not always be a possibility for everyone — people who are traveling internationally, for instance, may not have the required phone connection — or else they may be in a different time zone. Wi-Fi, however, is generally available and makes communicating through the Internet far easier and cheaper. So offering internet based tech support will be a boon for people on the go. The Greatest Disadvantage: Data Leak Risks Leakage of sensitive data has occurred so many times on various popular websites that people are now wary of giving in personal information on Internet forms. Making sure you have the requisite data security in place will be of considerable help here. Also, after getting the security measures, you must mention it on your form pages that you are a completely secure platform and have a strict confidentiality policy in place to safeguard users’ information. Lack of Human Touch Another small disadvantage ofweb-based tech supportis that customers can feel alienated. Talking to a computer may not be a very desirable situation for many people, especially those in the older demographic. A nice way to maneuver around this problem is by personalizing emails and chat responses as far as possible for different consumer personas. Also, you could include support content in the local language to make it more relatable. In any case, the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages, and web-based tech support is unavoidable, even if you continue to keep a calling system running to aid the former.

https://medium.com/@edcunningham_3740/its-not-voiceover-it-s-earover-60c2ba2cf09c?source=tag_archive---------81-----------------------,It’s not VoiceOver…It’s EarOver.,Written byEd Cunningham,"Ed Cunningham Follow -- Listen Share To headphone or not to headphone. That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the tangly mess that is the Sony MDR-7506 headphones, or take to take arms against a sea of aural self-indulgence, and by opposing, ditch the cans. If you’re new to voice over, you may have to get used to hearing yourself through headphones as you speak. This is tricky for some. It will often make beginners slow down and lose their natural talking rhythm; they’ll read in a one-word-at-a-time fashion, rather than read ahead and speak in phrases. Why doesn’t this happen to all voice actors who wear headphones? Their ear is above average. Not the cartilagey parts on the outside, best demonstrated by Alfred E. Newman. I’m talking about the intricate, delicate, hairy parts on the inside. People who master the art of voiceover have “a good ear” above all else. My first agent in Los Angeles was Steve Tisherman. A genius in many respects, he was the agent who developed and subsequently managed the talents of voiceover titan Don LaFontaine. You may remember Don’s gravelly voice serving up the words“In a World”a few thousand times in the 90s and 2000s, yes? Steve Tisherman said to me in our very first meeting, “You want to whisper your way to million bucks? It’s not voiceover. It’s earover.”Earover? That’s not very catchy, Steve. But, what can I say, I was 29 at the time and had no idea what the hell this Hollywood agent was saying to me. Who did he think he was talking to!? I was anactor.I had MFA training! I’d completed Arthur Lessac’s Kinesensic Training for the voice! I played Hamlet at Cambridge! (Or rather, Marc Antony at Chicago Shakepeare!) Who does thisagentthink he is, telling me how to perform narration? Fast forward sndfgsnjxh years… and yeah…I now understand the brilliance of Steve Tisherman. It ISearover, not voiceover. And the sooner you come to understand this, the sooner you’re on your way to that million bucks. “So…” you ask, “How do I develop a ‘good ear?’” The good news is, you probably already have one. In fact, you probably have two. The bad news is, you must be a consumer in the market that you wish to participate in. And if that’s commercial voiceover, then yes, you must listen to commercials. Lots of them. Don’t watch them. Listen to them. Close your eyes, and listen to the voiceover, as well as the music and sound effects. Do this for five minutes each day onispot.tv. Or, if you have an audition, prepare for it by watching that advertiser’s campaigns. What kind of voice did they hire most recently? Do the specs on your copy match the characteristics of the voice they used last, or are they trying to go in a different direction? Make it your business to participate in your business. If you’re interested in narrating audiobooks, start listening to narrators who possess similar vocal characteristics to your own. “She sounds sorta like me” is a eureka moment in the world of audiobook narration. Study her phrasing, her baseline intonation, her characterizations when reading dialogue. Pull up the voice recorder app on your phone, and repeat a paragraph that your vocal doppleganger has just read. (Audiobook narrators speak in paragraphs, not sentences. Try one on for size!) Now, play it back. Compare your read to her read. Now do it again, and see if you can somehow make your read better. This little exercise will help you groove your style, your pace, your breathing, your delivery. And it has nothing to do with your voice, but everything to do with your ear. Here’s another tip that a voiceover coach gave me when I was first starting out:If you’re going to inflect your voice, do it in half steps instead of whole steps.Think in terms of a piano keyboard — if you’re going to inflect upward with your voice, go from a C to C#, rather than a C to a D. Take for instance, the line “How are you today?” The writer of the brilliant line has made it clear in the specs that he needs a happy, energetic voice for this particular piece of copy. To most actors, that means there’s a good chance you’ll inflect your voice up and down in a more dynamic way than you would normally. Don’t do it! The writer’s direction is sometimes useful, but more often than not it’s a trap! (And we all fall for it.) Try saying “How are you today?” as if you’re talking to your significant other at six in the morning before you’ve had coffee. Keep it flat. Keep it decaffeinated. Say it a couple of times. Record it. Listen back. Then, return to your microphone and try again, this time putting just asmidgeof inflection back in. But do it half-heartedly. Or rather, in “half steps.” Now, do it again, and forget the entire exercise. Just “throw the line away” as voice directors like to say. All of this work is to train your ear. Not your voice. Of course, there are non-believers amongst us. Many casting directors in L.A. will often NOT have headphones in their recording booths. They’ll tell you, “Actors listen to themselves too much. I want a natural read, so no headphones.” But let me tell you, it’s jarring for many actors who are used to working with headphones to suddenly not have them. And while there may be some truth to headphones creating problems for the newcomer, every seasoned pro I know disagrees with these casting directors, but we adapt and make do. (That is our job ultimately.) It’s the casting director who misses out, because the seasoned pro has developed an ear, and they use that ear to produce narration that breathes life into a script and onto a screen in a way that people without a trained ear cannot. Singers use in-ear monitors when they sing. Why? Because their ear and their voice have become one and the same. If it truly bothers you to hear your own voice amplified while you’re reading, then ditch the cans! You can still develop a sharp ear without them. Just know that you may have to wear them one day at a job when you’re being directed by someone in another city. They’ll be on the phone, but somehow, magically, they’ll be speaking to you through your headphones. Many VO actors employ the one-on-one-off method for wearing headphones, where you slide one of the cans off your ear toward the back of your head. It’s a compromise that, hopefully, more casting directors will be open to in 2019. After all, this isearoverwe’re talking about.",Ed Cunningham,https://medium.com/@edcunningham_3740?source=post_page---byline--60c2ba2cf09c---------------------------------------,126,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg,2019-01-02T19:48:00.345Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@brittney.ball07/hello-world-e6933ff22ac7?source=tag_archive---------28-----------------------,Hello World,Written byBrittney Ball,"Brittney Ball Follow -- 8 Listen Share I would first like toThank Youfor taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites. You can read the articleHERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother, as a minority, and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning, the difficulty level, and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy, punny, and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women, and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold, strong, and demands attention and that’sEVERYTHINGI want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me andHAPPY NEW YEAR!",Brittney Ball,https://me.dm/@TechnicallySpeaking,593,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg,2019-01-03T21:20:13.461Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@oneroot/details-of-the-economic-model-of-rnt-3c9ce69ef622?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,ONEROOT Announces New Economic Model of RNT,Written byONEROOT,"ONEROOT Follow -- Listen Share Related video:https://youtu.be/ItZ0D04Gohc Founded in April 2017, ONEROOT is a blockchain technology solution provider focused on the development of underlying technologies. It is committed to building industry infrastructure, breaking the application threshold of blockchain technology and facilitating more external resources to enter the blockchain industry. Over the past year, ONEROOT has successively developed a decentralized transaction protocol R1, a distributed decentralized exchange DDEX, a distributed centralized exchange DCEX, high-performance public chains RNC, a user terminal Touch Wallet and other products, which have won recognition from top international partners in the industry. Mutual benefits and shared achievements are the consistent concept of ONEROOT, of which the core is fair and efficient transfer of value. RNT is the bridge connecting all links of the ecosystem, and therefore has a solid value base. With the rapid development of the blockchain industry, ONEROOT ecosystem continues to expand. As a result, the service targets have become more diversified, and new application scenarios have been emerging. Meanwhile, the functions and positioning of RNT have also changed. To this end, we have refined the application scenarios, clarified the relationship between supply and demand, and explained the value base of RNT from the function aspect. Transaction Scenario Transaction is the most mature application scenario in the blockchain industry and one of the main development directions of ONEROOT. Insufficient liquidity along with high development and maintenance costs is a challenge for all exchange operators. Guided by the concept of mutual benefits and shared achievements, ONEROOT’s trading solutions allow operators holding traffic to quickly deploy distributed exchanges, share transaction data and liquidity, meanwhile, improving transaction efficiency and greatly reducing the cost of R&D and maintenance as well as access to traffic of operators. As DDEX and DCEX bring together more and more exchanges, all participants will win through sharing. Within the ONEROOT distributed trading system, RNT has the following functions: (1) Stake or pay a certain amount of RNT to cooperate with ONEROOT to build DCEX or DDEX; (2) Discounts will be obtained for using RNT to pay transaction fees (see the rules of each cooperative exchange for specific rate); (3) After fully circulated, RNT will be used as the basic token to open trading pairs on all DDEX of ONEROOT; (4) Holding a certain amount of RNT will allow you to apply for token listing on ONEROOT DDEX where all RNT holders will vote. Once passed, the token will start for transaction on all ONEROOT DDEX; (5) RNT holders can participate in the vote for token listing. Public Chain Scenario Public chain is the underlying infrastructure that connects the ONEROOT ecosystem. For this reason, ONEROOT has developed an asset-friendly, high-performance public-chain RNC. By mapping external assets and built-in decentralized exchanges, it is possible to securely and quickly realize the registration, distribution and circulation of assets. This also, breaks the performance bottleneck of Ethereum, which greatly enhances user experiences of decentralized transactions. RNT will serve as fuel to drive RNC operations, including: (1) Be used as Gas when transactions are sent, contracts are executed and other operations are conducted on the chain； (2) When trading on DEX, you can get a corresponding fee discount if you hold a certain amount of RNT; (3) Be used as GAS fees for operations on other chains Technical Services and Ecological Expansion As a leading blockchain technology service company, ONEROOT can provide all-round and reliable support for the demand side. With the continuous increase of partners, the ONEROOT ecosystem will continue to expand, giving RNT a more solid value base: (1) ONEROOT will provide technical services such as decentralized transactions to the demand side without charge. However, in order to protect the rights and interests of users, the demand side needs to stake a certain amount of RNT as a security deposit; (2) Due to limited human resources, ONEROOT cannot provide technical services to all demand sides at the same time. Therefore, users can get priority by paying a certain amount of RNT. This part of the tokens will be directly transferred into the address of the ONEROOT Foundation and be managed by the Foundation. Tips: As a digital business infrastructure, ONEROOT welcomes all merchants to provide services in the ecosystem. However, in order to protect the rights and interests of users, merchants need to stake a certain amount of RNT. The benefits that ONEROOT receives in the ecological cooperation will be returned to the holders of RNT in the form of airdrops. Metaphorically speaking, if a blockchain project is regarded as a human body, tokens are the circulation system that connects various organs, transports nutrients and transmits values. Meanwhile, the economic model is the operating mechanism of the system, which directly determines whether the project can develop healthily. How to design a self-consistent economic model is a proposition that all projects are constantly exploring. The significance of RNT is to rationally distribute relevant benefits so that value can be circulated among all participants to form a fair and efficient business collaboration model. A healthy economic model is not static. While ONEROOT is still a new project and with consideration given to the development of the ecosystem, we acknowledge RNT will face various problems. However, we believe that with the support of the community, ONEROOT team will adhere to the initial and make positive adjustments. At the same time, RNT will also play an irreplaceable role, and continuously enhance the intrinsic value with the support of global traffic. Tips: The total amount of RNT is 400 million and there will never be further issue. Currently, RNT can be traded on dozens of exchanges around the world: ________________ English: Telegram-en/ONEROOT web/R1 protocol Reddit/Twitter/Medium/Linkedin/Facebook/Github Instagram: @onerootnetwork Youtube: @OneRoot Project Korean: Naver blog/Kakao Chinese: Telegram-cn/Weibo Official QQ group: 6644849 Official WeChat account: oneroot_admin",ONEROOT,https://medium.com/@oneroot,3,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg,2019-01-25T10:32:06.112Z,Medium

https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/blockchain-is-not-spelled-b-i-t-c-o-i-n-80a3a0a0fb8a?source=tag_archive---------101-----------------------,Blockchain is not spelled B-I-T-C-O-I-N,By Mohammad Musharraf onALTCOIN MAGAZINE,"By Mohammad Musharraf onALTCOIN MAGAZINE Mohammad Musharraf Follow The Capital -- Listen Share October 31st, 2018 marked the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin and it was celebrated exuberantly across the globe. But the question is, do all of us really understand what the underlying technology — blockchain — is, and how it is different from and much more than just Bitcoin? Well, before we go deeper into comprehending blockchain, let’s understand what Bitcoin is. Based on the years' old concept of cryptography, Satoshi Nakamoto (an unidentified individual or group of people) wrote a whitepaper for Bitcoin that was published in 2008. He had successfully created a system that would go on to show the world a financial system that negates the use of all kinds of intermediaries. Bitcoin has two parts: Bitcoin token and Bitcoin ledger/blockchain. So, yes, Bitcoin was the first ever blockchain to be developed and put to use along with its own cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But, in 2013, Vitalik Buterin, set out to invent his own blockchain that would improve the inefficiencies of Bitcoin (the blockchain). Now that you have a brief idea that blockchain and Bitcoin can be made to sit on two different chairs across the table, let’s delve deeper into understanding blockchain technology and how it can disrupt various industries throughout the world. Well, it’s a chain of blocks, obviously. These blocks are used to store records and are linked to one another through an immutable encryption technology. All the blocks that are verified to be added to the blockchain contain three elements: a hash (‘checksum’ in layman terms) of the previous block (except for the parent block), a time stamp, and the transaction data. But what makes Blockchain so special? Unlike other ledgers that are used to store data and process transactions — of value or information — blockchain sets itself apart with its three major properties:decentralization(a.k.a distributedness), immutability,andtransparency. The first, most celebrated feature of blockchain is its decentralization, meaning no single entity controls what goes on on the blockchain. It is an anonymous peer-to-peer system that connects the two parties involved in the transaction directly and helps them complete the transaction without fail. Being decentralized also makes it resistant to any breaking points that could be attacked to edit or delete any form of transaction data. Hence, once a transaction is registered on this distributed ledger, it becomes unalterable. This brings us to the second most important property of blockchain, i.e. its immutability. Blockchains are public ledgers which means that the system works transparently and registered data can be viewed by the public, however, the identity of the party involved in the transaction might not be discovered. Why is it so important? Well, to have a ledger that stores important transaction data highly protected is quite an important thing. And blockchain with its properties — decentralization, immutability, and transparency — does just that. It creates the highest form of security for ledgers. That too without any third party involved in it. Because even they might make mistakes. The fact that Blockchain negates the involvement of any third parties in all sort of transactions makes it a note-worthy technology. For example, traditional bank transfers, especially for international transactions, take some great deal of time for completion and also cost a considerable amount. On the other hand, blockchain transactions will not only make your transactions more secure and fast but would also cost you a negligible sum of money. Just so you know, Blockchain is no longer about monetary transactions only. As time is going by, there are a number of other applications of blockchain that are being discovered. The perfection and ease with which blockchain stores all data can be used to disrupt many industries. From agriculture to retail, from shipment to AI, VR and AR, from gaming to sports, blockchain has already set foot to revolutionize the world, “block by block.” Even more, new possibilities have been unleashed for the blockchain due to the success of Ethereum with practical implementation of smart contracts. Smart contracts are code implemented to certain systems that get activated and perform certain tasks when the encoded conditions within the contract are met. These smart contracts built over blockchain have innumerable use cases. From being implemented for something as basic as automatically switching on and off your room’s AC when the temperature conditions are met to something as important as managing loans, financial bonds, taxation and more, the uses of smart contracts are vast, may be endless. I hope that you’ve been able to draw a clear line between Blockchain and Bitcoin by now. If you’ve anything to add, do comment below.

https://medium.com/@kmnersten/through-your-childs-eyes-6b2a43ffb618?source=tag_archive---------188-----------------------,Through Your Child’s Eyes,Written byKristin Nersten,"Kristin Nersten Follow -- Listen Share What does your child see during the day? Hopefully your face. Maybe some toys. Possibly some outdoor scenery. A car seat, their car mirror. The inside of Target if we’re being honest. But what else? More than likely, they see a lot of your phone. It’s always handy, and I get it. You want it right on hand to be able to snap the best pictures at the most opportune times. That’s the beauty of the cameras on phones. It’s convenient and you just never know when you might see the perfect picture. But then they start to associate seeing you with seeing a phone. Where are we going to go from here? I challenge you to think about how much you’re holding onto your phone, how much your child looks at you and sees your phone, how much the phone is in front of their face instead of your face being in front of them. How many “perfect pictures” do you need of them anyway? What are you going to do with all of them? Maybe post them on Facebook, on Instagram, your VSCO if you have that type of thing. Someday you might get around to printing them, only to realize they’ve grown up so much and don’t look the same anymore so you only have one of the pictures up and then shove the rest in an envelope in a drawer. What does that mean for the rest of the thousands, yes thousands, of pictures we have? I try to leave my phone places. In the room, by the couch. I make it a point not to bring it when we go places. It scares me when I think about the fact my child could get to a point where he is more excited to see my phone than my face because it might mean I’ll be interacting with him to get a smile for a picture. All he wants is the interaction and that’s what he’ll get with the phone. I think that someday, my great-grandchildren will love to see the pictures I’ve taken. While that is undoubtably true, they aren’t going to need to see two-thousand pictures from a six month span. They’ll want to see enough to get a picture of what my little one looked like growing up, to get an overall picture of what life was like and what they were like as a child. They don’t need a play by play of every single day, of every single smile or temper tantrum. Phones are amazing and it’s great to see how you can remain connected with friends and families who live further away. But even they don’t need hour by hour updates. Even if you send multiple pictures or videos per week, it doesn’t have to be the minute something happens. Celebrate with your children and be present. And yes, capture the moments because they are great to look back on. But don’t be so bent on capturing every single moment that when you think back on these days you see it through your phone screen. Don’t be so caught up in making sure everything is documented that you don’t have any real memories. And don’t be so hung up on your phone that your children associate you with a phone. Make sure they have memories of you, too.",Kristin Nersten,https://medium.com/@kmnersten?source=post_page---byline--6b2a43ffb618---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg,2019-01-02T15:11:42.081Z,Medium

With friends we used our New Year’s holiday to a have a private programming trip and analysed financial as well as social media trends in correlation to cryptocurrencies values. My Resume, the long-term global Bitcoin trend couldn’t be predicted accurately, because the internet currency is not a repetition of a similar pattern. And after our programming holidays, we had to focus on job tasks.Alled with BBB ended quickly after a hackathon group participant secretly, seethis git commit, placed a coin miner on our site — it’s uncomfortable with me to this day You hear much about cryptocurrencies, but the really special thing about it actually the concept behind it, the Blockchain technology. In order to understand Blockhain one has to understand the technological fundamentals, consenus algorithms, the functioning of fullnodes and the peculiarities of different platforms. Within the framework of the projects in thePorsche Digital Labin Berlin we were able to do exactly that. We have worked our way up from the basics to smart contract programming. This has laid a very good foundation and allowed us to solidly evaluate use and business cases. In many Hackathon events you could get to know a ton of Blockchain ideas, great people and new technologies first hand. These were often cross-industry and showed the whole field of possibilities. Especially exciting were the three hackathons, where I worked for Porsche with Volkswagen AG, Zalando and Adidas, where we could support social entrepreneurs with supply chain transparency. Once one has explored the basics of block chains and transactions, including different consensus methods, it becomes clear what the advantages and disadvantages of the technology are. And also where there are limits. The original blockchain is supposed to make intermediaries unnecessary and distribute the trust ‘censorship free’ fairly among all users, but today’s proof-of-work (PoW) approach devours vast amounts of energy. Even the alternatives have not yet been able to assert themselves. Distributed computing and smart contracts are interesting for companies and process design. However, such a network grows virally if it is ensured that the investment costs are secure in the long term (e.g. through public permissionless systems without PoW). Visiting Meetups to learn about specific topics helped a lot: Although most blockchain platform ideas have not yet been implemented and are far from a productive stage and ‘blockchain nowadays mainly runs on PowerPoint’ (citingIngo Brenckmann) — we already looked at the following technologies. Beside the immutable Ledger of a Blockchain we need for example for the privacy and the data protection (also in the sense of GDPR) also erasable and encrypted data (e.g. with personal data). A blockchain seldom comes alone and needs a distributed file system. Here also Quantum secure encryption plays a big role — this topic we also deal with in 2019. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) also include other methods that are of application-specific interest, such as the ‘Gossip over Gossip’ protocol (e.g. fromHashGraph) or decentralized Tangle (e.g. described byHelix). When we think about the future of blockchain applications, Smart Contracts and distributed computing play the most important role. Designed with zero knowledge proofs such asZK-STARKsandzk-SNARKsin mind, these programs would no longer have to be executed in parallel on all blockchain network participants, but only on a single one — verifiable by the others. Thus, the complexity of the programs can be increased ten thousand times nowadays. And then, in the more distant future, whole applications can run decentrally, so-called dApps. After an intense period of information gathering and testing with prototyping, I was able to share some knowledge in presentations and share it on one or the other panel. Many useful applications can be sorted into one of the categories — but are still at different stages of implementation and deployment. RECORD KEEPING: The protection against data manipulation of any information is an optimal and very feasible task for Blockchain. For this purpose, only the digital fingerprints (e.g. hashes) have to be written on a secure network. (For example forsecure video timestampingby my colleagueJagrut Kosti) PAYMENT: In order to bring a payment service to the masses by means of security tokens on blockchain (e.g. into a car, which pays the parking fees itself), you need more price-stable, less volatile cryptocurrencies. This can be done through extremely high market penetration or more likely through government guarantees / regulation. But both can take a long time and are difficult to influence. DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING / SMART CONTRACTS: This creates stable, upwardly compatible interfaces between players / users and companies.SUPPLY CHAINandPRODUCT LIFECYCLEare a particularly large field of application in this context — this area may also grow together across industries. SECURITY TOKEN:According to studies, the token as a certificate of ownership of real values or representation of a value (e.g. of company shares) will take a heavy toll, but also requires stronger regulation through a clear legislative statement. In 2018 we took the technology apart and learned a lot.

https://medium.com/@MohrWom/top-social-media-and-marketing-trends-2019-91e1f44e84c4?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,Top Social Media and Marketing Trends 2019,Written byMelanie Mohr,"Melanie Mohr Follow -- Listen Share While we’re busy atWOM Protocolcreating a brand new user-generated marketing channel that incentivizes and rewards honest word-of-mouth recommendations, I’m going to talk about marketing and social media trends in this article of 2019. I’m digital media professional and entrepreneur with 20 years of experience in editorial strategy, content creation, digital marketing and mobile applications. I’ve founded YEAY and WOM Protocol to help Gen Z creators truly expand their digital footprint as pioneer creators. But enough about me, marketing and social media are incredible domains of mobile, storytelling, video and youth culture that’s creating a tapestry of engagement never been seen before in the history of the internet. While some of us are bringing word-of-mouth and content distribution to distributed ledger technology and dApps, older social platforms continue to evolve as consumers prefer new behaviors and more trendy channels. With 8,000 followers onLinkedIn, I’m posting across channels bringing awareness and advocacy for GenZ-centric solutions. As retail and technology brands need to scale their influence they are realizing the importance of establishing peer content and relatable influencers who create user generated content that are relatable to their audiences andtruly foster the spirit of their brand communities that reflect and build true loyalty among their customers. The push for social media followers and engagement online is augmented by real people, someone that is the face of the brand that’s not only knowledgeable, but someone you can trust that has customers and their preferences at heart.The personal brand has never been more important as in 2019. Vitalik Buterin makes Ethereum relatable, just as Elon Musk makes Tesla have its own magic. Trust is a funny thing with brands, it’s hard to build and can be lost easily enough. Social media and marketing isn’t just about engagement, but mattering to consumers. Nike’s Ad on Colin Kaepernick wasn’t just inspirational, it was genius. Nike sales reflected that.Brands need to connect with the values of their target audienceand truly connect for both trust and inspiration to occur. In many cases, it’s really that simple. The modern consumer is on mobile, while chatting, while perhaps consuming another screen. So how do you stand out with a brand story? Increasingly micro video, stories, andmicro video apps are engaging Millennials and emerging Gen Z consumers that break through the noisefor a few powerful moments.TikTok grew its user base in 2018while acquiring musical.ly but providing a new kind of storytelling. Instagram became even more popular in 2018 by adopting Snapchat like disappearing micro video stories. The social media feed has been altered in 2019, and will never be the same again. If you are an advertising platform like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other big one — chances area lot of your traffic and accounts are not real. The bot purge of 2018 has led to other adaptations of fake traffic, such asfake sponsored content,fake influencer marketing metrics, and campaigns that are able to alter human behavior into “bot-like” behavior patterns online. Therefore newer platforms with more AI are likely to have an edge over older platforms that are easily hacked by collective sentiment manipulation. In our transition of mobile consumption patterns to video,YouTube > Instagram & Facebook combined. Considering the traffic changes in 2018, 2019 is the year of YouTube and Twitch (Amazon) like experiences that younger consumers prefer. They consume a lot more video content and the rest of the world is only starting to catch up as how we behave on social media changes. This means creators on YouTube can grow more sustainable brands that transition better to other micro video apps. YouTube’s algorithm appears superior to Instagram’s for getting high quality content to rise to the top. YouTube and Netflix are likely to have a good 2019, because it’s all about creating high quality content. It’s a bold statement but I believe blockchain tech will truly begin to impact content distribution and social media platforms in a more mainstream way in 2019.Video and social apps might start to utilize cryptoeconomic principles, incentives or a cryptocurrency like a stablecoinpegged to the U.S. dollar that might go more mainstream such as one on WhatsApp that is planned by Facebook’s blockchain division. If FAANG stock and crypto are both experiencing “corrections”, what’s to say that the two won’t get married and overlap in some significant way? Obviously I’m biased to theWOM token based on the WOM Protocol. In an era of media publications going the subscription model route for the best revenue generation without advertising traffic manipulating their results, something incredible is occurring.Brands are bundling their subscription to target shared audiences. Recently in China, Alibaba backed Ele.Me teamed up with Bilibili in a promotional discount subscription, to get the best of both worlds. Both of these services target Millennials and GenZ mobile users hyper-active with digital consumption. Alibaba in fact, has akind of joint subscriptionmodel for many of its related apps and partners that reminds one of Amazon Prime, but for content and O2O service apps. For discount savvy Millennials, this is the ultimate strategy. Brands in 2019 will need to do less Ads (they won’t be as efficient) and drive more organic traffic via authentic content. Besides creating incredible content, influencers and brands need toparticipate actively on niche channelssuch as LinkedIn, Twitter chats, Facebook Groups, Subreddits, apps that relate to their domain (such as Telegram and Discord if blockchain) and optimizetraffic from curator and app congregation sitessuch as Flipboard, Medium, Hacker News — and wherever else they can show value. Organic referral traffic boosts SEO and visibility of a piece of content and alerts algorithms (and in some cases curators/editors) to pin the content in a tag. A good piece of content must be relatable, having emotional impact and elicit comments and strong interactions. These signals again tell the AI on an app or platform that it’s valuable. In 2019 a more authentic internet will be forming with algorithms that are less hackable. If you have been following apps like Snapchat that have been doing some interesting things with AR. AR could bring in new content delivery approaches that could be immersive and helpful for content creatives and brands. Where I’m a bit more excited is inhow interactive AR content could create more collaborative social media experiences. As compared with VR and chatbots, I find AR much more direct-to-consumer friendly. But could AR touch our mobile-native emotions? Maybe not as radically as some marketers might hope in 2019. Gen Z (born 1995-) are a rather large demographic who grew up on mobile and support things like crypto, decentralization and online entrepreneurship. However they also appear more inclusion orientated, with a stronger activism spirit than Millennials, and perhaps more street smarts combined with business smarts. Whatever your opinion of young people these days, they are incredibly important to many brands, as they have entered the workforce and have time and money to spend. In 2019 there will be a fair degree of hype and information about how to reach Gen Z better and create customer experiences that attract them. Micro influencers deliver more ROI than typical big-time influencers since they have tight niche peer to peer influence usually targeted to a particular audience. Since they are viewed as even more authentic, they are also considered more trustworthy. As influencer marketing continues to scale, their influence is stretching to Gen Z apps where micro video content predominates. This is meaning brands and influencers have more opportunity to grow in the new kinds of aspects of the attention economy that are coming into being. Micro influencers and micro video should continue to gain in importance in 2019. As Amazon and Walmart battle over India’s E-commerce market there’s an even more interesting phenomena going on with apps. 2019 is then the year when India’s attention economy succumbs to Chinese apps. This idea that Chinese companies cannot scale globally is no longer true in 2019, as ByteDance’s apps are becoming popular in India. In fact,the Chinese takeover of Indian app ecosystemand its attention economy appears real. The data appears to be pointing to ByteDance taking over Facebook’s place globally, starting with Asia. China’s influence over India with companies such as Xiaomi, Ant Financial, Huawei and others is only getting started. However, ByteDance is the most valuable startup in the world that’s leading app innovation. Stay tuned for more social and marketing insights, this list is a work in progress.",Melanie Mohr,https://medium.com/@MohrWom?source=post_page---byline--91e1f44e84c4---------------------------------------,82,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*j6DZr4dV1yr7IALp.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*j6DZr4dV1yr7IALp.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*j6DZr4dV1yr7IALp.jpg,2019-01-02T17:27:10.013Z,Medium

The nature of the work, the languages used to create the work, the creativity in the field make for an exciting industry bursting with possibilities. Part of our mission here is toconnect growing U.S companies with experienced and vetted developerssouth of the border. This means we’re on the frontlines working with developers and company managers as they navigate the changing landscape of hiring, outsourcing, and the developer universe. About this time last year, we were exploring somenew technologiesto watch out for. A year ago some of the most popular programming languages included Rust, Smalltalk, TypeScript, Swift, and Go. These were languages that are loved by programmers but might not have the highest demand. The mostin-demandlanguages at the end of the last year based on data from job boards were Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++. Today, these languages remain on the top of the list, although the order has been slightly altered. According to various sites, the programming languages that are coming up for 2019 include Python, Java, and JavaScript. It seems Python has moved up in rank. Companies are often skeptical of the benefits of outsourcing tech roles but the truth is that many companies today — including today’s leading giants —have used outsourcing because of its cost-effectivenessand array of other benefits. Some of these giants of course include Google, Facebook, and Apple. As a hiring partner, we are deeply entrenched in Mexico’s tech community that has now gained world notoriety. Cities like Monterrey and Jalisco have seen a blossoming of young, energetic, and creative developing talent coming out of the most prestigious educational institutions of the country. We have built relationships with many of these eager developers and have found them homes working for growing U.S companies looking forspecialized talent to bring diversity of thoughtto their workforce. The talent coming out ofLatin America has several benefits for U.S companiesincluding the fact that many developers exceed in languages like Python and have expertise in mobile development. In addition to their technical excellence, outsourcing talent from places like Mexico has added cost-effectiveness, cultural connections, geographical proximity, and versatile workers. We are looking forward to continuing our mission to helping mutually beneficial relationships form between thriving U.S companies in need of IT talent and developers eager for opportunities to use their skills, knowledge, and coding chops.

Now it wants to put robots inside. Well-known for its automated assembly lines, Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes, helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone. Machines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet, every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic, physical problem: the stronger a robot gets, the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves, a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor, Gill Pratt, heading its effort. “This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them,” said Morten Paulsen, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co., who’s covered the robotics industry for decades.

https://levelup.gitconnected.com/agile-from-a-developers-perspective-27b23ea665f0?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,Agile development from a programmer’s perspective,What is Agile ?,"Dasith Kuruppu Follow Level Up Coding -- Listen Share I have been practicing agile for a few years now, and over the years I have come to form a few opinions / beliefs of my own. Specifically where things can go wrong in agile and where things can be improved in the process. Before going forward If you haven’t practiced agile you may have a few questions — What is Agile ? Agile development refers to any development process that is aligned with the concepts of theAgile Manifesto. Agile development refers to any development process that is aligned with the concepts of theAgile Manifesto. Why is it considered important ? Its important because it addresses many critical shortcomings on traditional methods like the waterfall & spiral methods.The Manifesto was developed by a group fourteen leading figures in the software industry, and reflects their experience of what approaches do and do not work for software development. Its important because it addresses many critical shortcomings on traditional methods like the waterfall & spiral methods.The Manifesto was developed by a group fourteen leading figures in the software industry, and reflects their experience of what approaches do and do not work for software development. There are several implementations of agile, scrum being one of the most popular and one which I have been adopting for the past few years. Something I have noticed that is done by most people (my self included) while following agile, is that they often skip major steps or values that are core to the agile process. And such things result in agile being practiced in very unproductive/counter-productive and frustrating ways for both developers and product owner. Let’s take the most popular agile implementation — scrum.The basic values essential to scrum are : Courage could be realized in many different ways. Courage is shown by disagreeing with something the product owner wants (with reason of course). Courage is shown by accepting failure and being honest with the product owner when something does not work out as planned or expected. Courage is shown by saying “NO” to product owner when asked to take more tasks than you can handle. Courage is shown by disagreeing or pointing out flaws to your team or superiors. Courage is also shown by rigorously defending what you believe or know to be true and even more courage is shown by accepting and realizing what you knew, held or believed to be true isactually wrong! All this may seem like something that is up to an individual, but I think it to be quite different. I believe that ideally in a scrum team all members must create a platform on which members are encouraged to put forward their ideas, thoughts, arguments, and concerns before a team comfortably and without any repercussions. Some members may voice their concerns or thoughts no matter what, as it’s in their nature while others may try to hide behind the ones that do so and simply nod away. A good scrum team should identify those members and bring out to share what they have on their mind, as it is often the case that they hold a lot on their mind without the courage to bring it before a team. If no one is having disagreements or saying “no” occasionally, it’s an indication that there is something wrong. One of the most important factors that I personally feel that should be focused and encouraged are these people who say the hard truths or bring up the unsettling but necessary facts as its often an uphill battle for the ones that do raise these concerns. This will help in identifying key failing points in projects and thus enabling action for recovery or an early failure rather than waiting until it is too late. Agile is all about improving with feedback and, more often than not, courage becomes the basis for the feedback to happen. Therefore, courage plays a major role among the rest of the values. Focus, this means that the focus is usually limited to a “sprint” which narrows down the scope of a project by what “tasks” are taken into the sprint. A sprint can be a predetermined length of time on which all members commit to delivering a set of tasks within that period of time. A selected set of tasks are focused on each sprint. This works and seems great in theory. But sometimes it is necessary to consider a possible direction the project would take in the long run when taking on a task so that you don’t end up crippling your project progress later on. Say when a major refactoring or in worse cases an entire rewrite of a module or modules occurs, which could have been avoided with a bit more planning or more insight on the project. This means focus on a sprint by sprint basis is good, but you must also plan with awareness as to where the project is finally heading. Commitment, there needs to be several commitments for scrum to work. First everyone on the team needs to make a commitment towards the tasks that are taken into a sprint and the sprint goal, not just as an individual but as a team itself. Another important commitment is that you commit to scrum fully and not just skip parts of scrum when it feels convenient. It is also equally important to know that this commitment should never turn into a hard-coded contract where all the tasks taken would be expected to be delivered by the end of the sprint. It is all about showing the effort put forth by individuals and the team and being fully transparent throughout the entire process. In a complex, creative, and highly unpredictable world of software development, a commitment on this scope is often not fully possible. Agile is a way to address this major issue when unpredictability and frequent changes in scope over time could not be matched with an initially agreed rigid plan. If you are doing things in such a way, you probably are practicing something entirely different than agile, and in my opinion, should never be practiced in such a way and would end up leaving a bad impression to all parties in the end. Respect is another important factor that is essential for agile to work. This involves believing that people that you work with are naturally resourceful, creative, and capable. This also requires an unbiased hiring practice where hiring takes place purely focused on individuals skills / abilities and the results produced. Given that both these factors are available, this creates an ideal platform for people to respect each other regardless of people’s diverse backgrounds, experiences, and range of skills.Once this platform is created, it is all about trusting the team to do what they do best and getting everyone more autonomous by accepting them as professionals who organize and manage their own work. We also respect that people are doing their best given what they know at the time and their current resourcesthus we enable transparency and change of actions / direction headed. We create a platform on which everyone's opinions and perspectives are given the opportunity to be heard. When people feel they have been heard and taken into consideration, it becomes easier for them to fully support and respect the team decisions even if the decision was not their preference. Transparency is another key factor in an agile environment. Being open about our work helps create transparency about progress, success, and failure. Without transparency, any attempts to inspect and adapt will be flawed. Transparency coupled with Respect enables team members to ask for help and get help from anyone. Transparency also helps teams to make mistakes, accept them, and take the necessary corrective action while being fully open about it. This helps all involved parties to be aware of it and help in a positive way to take the necessary corrective actions or change direction. This transparency should also be a two way street where both the development team and the product owner alike is transparent on what they are doing or planning to do. This creates a much better understanding and trust between the two parties allowing better products/ results. If the above values are present within an environment where such values are appreciated and actively practiced, only then could it actually be called “agile”. Often, it is mostly the process or efficiency of a process that companies seek to improve by placing less significance on the values. However, one needs to realize that there is a fundamental trade-off in simply focusing on optimizing a process. Running an efficient process requires standardization and control to yield predictable outcomes which often comes at the cost of innovation, which on the other hand requires experimentation. It means trying new things, most of which are going to fail. It is often essential that innovation takes place as well, or you would end up with the most flawless and efficient process that is years obsolete. I believe that innovation, research, and trying things out is one of the major factors often lost, forgotten, and missed from a sprint or hidden from product owner as something that’s straying far from sprint goals. However, in a forever changing world of software development, it is important that this is given a significant focus and the transparency it deserves!

But, in 2005, she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net, severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short, she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved, but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So,Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her. Slawnych is maker, and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell, who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro tosnap photos, and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic, the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release, but also panning and tilting. The device Slawnych came up with sits inside a3D-printedenclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components. Those arean Arduino, servos, and microphone. By interpreting Pioro’s voice commands, the device can pan, tilt, and trigger the camera so she can shoot all the photos she likes on her own.

https://medium.com/@fantoni/latin-american-tech-and-vc-in-2019-40e3eefacf9e?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,Latin American tech and VC in 2019,Let’s start with regional trends,"Federico Antoni Follow -- 1 Listen Share As with many other amateur writers, my writing is first a personal exercise. It’s my way to process what I see, organize my thoughts and understand my world. It helps me have a prepared mind when investing and supporting portfolio companies. My predictions for the year are notes to self, as subjective and informed as for the next VC’s opinion. I submit these thoughts so you know me better and somewhat understand what I do. I post these predictions to start the conversation for the year in Latin American tech — plus it’s a fun exercise. If last year felt confusing sometimes depressing, this year will feel worse. The world will face new challenges under terrible leadership. Absent a violent and unexpected shock, the US will fare well economically but will probably have a year of reckoning dealing with its daemons. Fred Wilson has abold predictionon this. A global bear market coupled with unprecedented volatility will mostly spare the startup economy more vigorous after a rally of IPOs in the first half of the year. Despite the resilience, global venture capital will appear more scarce due to more cautious investors and global volatility. Investors tend to focus on portfolio allocation and follow-on rounds when going through an economic downturn. One unexpected consequence of US travails may be American tech investors seeking additional diversification outside of the US either by pushing portfolio cos to expand internationally or by investing directly in high growth verticals in promising markets. They will realize Uber IPO premium price on Lyft comes not from US market leadership but from international exposure. Silicon Valley investors that ventured outside of the comfort of the bay area will begin to outperform peers. LPs will take note. I think the massive trend of venture capital globalization as seen below will get stronger this year. In this context colored by our own national complications, Latin American tech will cement all the progress made during thefantastic 2018. I think total VC investment for this year will miss last year’s mark while the number of deals will go up. Let’s start with regional trends The entrepreneurial ecosystem in Mexico will have a tough year. The new administration will halt all support to the high impact sector. Mexican VC industry will consolidate. The best will thrive and build on what we have learned as an industry since 2013. I’m afraid Argentinian and Colombian ecosystem will miss a great opportunity. Large corporates and family offices will underinvest yet another year in their unique talent. Chile will be a great surprise growing from acceleration sweetheart to regional tech hub. A generation of outstanding and opinionated entrepreneurs will lead cash-rich corporates and institutional investors to invest more in tech. The best local VCs will federate around this new mindset as technical talent supports solid industry growth. I bet Brazil tech will take more risks this year expanding decisively to Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia. We might see some M&A activity as Brazilians learn from past failures. Some random sector notes I think the future of commerce will be the most active battlefield where American tech, Chinese challengers and regional corporates fight for supremacy. Latin American banks will make their first big move in Fintech probably in Mexico, Brazil or Chile. I bet it’s a startup that starts with a C :) After the big wallet wave in 2018 in Mexico, projects will be canceled, discarded or abandoned. Wallets as features will, for the most part, disappear or stay irrelevant. Regional VCs will be more cautious in Fintech deploying capital in E-commerce, Edtech, and HealthTech. If you are building something in these sectors, 2019 may be the year your startup finally scales. Mobility will consolidate further in the region behind Uber, Didi and maybe Cabify. Mobility-As-A-Service models will win the region. Expect some acquisitions and aqui-hires. I bet Uber buys Lime in part because of its successful expansion to Mexico. I expect the first batch of successful products built on the chain that reaches Latin America will inspire the next generation of Latin American founders. As MIT argues,blockchains will start to become boring. In a nutshell, if nothing terrible happens, 2019 will feel like a long year but one where Latin American tech has a chance to thrive. Bring it all! I wish you all a happy year, full of learnings and love.",Federico Antoni,https://medium.com/@fantoni/what-happened-in-latin-american-tech-in-2018-ebf8e28ba31c,81,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg,2019-01-02T14:30:25.721Z,Medium

Cook Follow -- Listen Share Reading on ePaper display is generally a pleasant experience, but what about if you want to use it to store sheet music? This may be a convenient storage method, but when playing music takes up both hands, it’s a bit inconvenient to reach over and swipe the screen. To help his musician brother out with this conundrum, hacker “mosivers” came up with awireless foot pedal for turning pages. He first attempted to spoof a capacitive input on the Kindle’s touchscreen, but after some initial success, he found this method to be impractical, and decided to instead go the Wi-Fi route. This involved first jailbreaking the Kindle, then installing several pieces of software and creating a page flip script to be executed remotely. After all of that preparatory work, it was time to build the physical unit. It uses a NodeMCUESP8266dev board to generate a web server, which allows for linking between the two devices without any intermediate Wi-Fi connection. The programmed board was then secured in an enclosure in order to hold up repeated toe taps, with a pair of buttons used for changing the page. While this hack is meant for musicians, mosivers notes that it could also be useful for those with disabilities, or even for those who simply find hand swiping inconvenient.",Jeremy S.

It’s kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.” — Her (2013). “Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It’s kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.” — Her (2013). — Inthe 21st Century dating scene, many singles are longing for ‘a deeper connection’ in addition to finding chemistry with ‘the right one.’ With the advent of apps such as Tinder or Bumble, it can seem even easier — or harder, depending on who you talk to — to find that special someone worth sharing your life with. What used to be a process relegated for matchmakers, mixers, and clubs everywhere is now harnessed in the internet’s potential. No longer do you have to leave your home to find somebody special — you can scroll through an online marketplace of people on your phone, tablet or computer.One of my previous articles dictated how this has changed the dating game… (…But it remained mum on the inevitable consequences artificial-intelligence will cause to human-relationships everywhere). A quick scroll through search engines reveals where we’re at already. In places like Japan —which is already experiencing historically low marriage and birthratesdue to several socioeconomic factors,middle-aged-men can be rentedto act not only as private confidants but to perform tasks involving advice or listen to troubles ailing clients. Services like these can deter the stress friends and family members bring into life’s fray — especially if questions involving romance pop up. There are already services in the United States whereartificial-intelligence can take care of older demographicsbut when it comes to romance and companionship, many modern video games can allow the player character to couple with eligible bachelors or bachelorettes over the course of the game (the space-operaMass Effect, the farming-simulationHarvest Moon, or even the high-fantasyElder Scrollsseries are notorious for having these features). Even if romance isn’t the main objective of the game, it’s at least offered to make the virtual world seem more…human…than it normally would be. But…what if romance is an interactive medium’s main objective? “Oh, I see. You don’t like real girls.” — Blade Runner 2049 (2017). “Oh, I see. You don’t like real girls.” — Blade Runner 2049 (2017). — Nobody’s perfect. While people tend to search for a mate that’s going to be compatible in personality, goals, and desired looks, websites and apps are already helping people scale down to a niche that definesexactlywhat their preference is. Even in spite of this, online-dating is never a sure thing. If there is a demographic surplus of eligible people, some may be left out in the cold. To illustrate this,an entire industry has arisen in places such as Chinato help the overflow of single men connect with a relationship. If suitable mates are in short supply, something has to give. Popular culture has been touching on the idea of a virtual mate ever since complex programming became a mainstream idea. Relatively early works such as Philip K. Dick’sDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep(1968) and Isaac Asimov’sForward the Foundation(1993) all contain the exploration of romance between human and non-human. Today, films such asHer(2013),Ex Machina(2015),Blade Runner: 2049(2017) — the film being a sequel to thefirst adaptationof the aforementionedElectric Sheep, and TV shows likeBlack Mirror (withepisodes such as ‘Be Right Back’ (2013) and ‘Hang the DJ’ (2017) orWestworld(2016 — ) all playing or toying with the idea of what a romance between a human and a machine would look like… …assuming it’s even possible. The biggest appeal for a virtual companion is the ability for the user to design one that fits their schedule, needs, and personality. Instead of having to work out date nights or go through a bad relationship, many are leaving software-engineers to do the dirty work for them. This is leading to games and apps moving past the standard ‘dating-sim’ style of game and into ones where the goal is to reach avirtual ongoing relationship.Why bother searching for the real thing when a virtual one is already programmed for you? Although some may see games like these as harmless fun, it may not help for those who already struggle withunrealistic expectations for their love life. While professing your love for an artificial-intelligence may be something that only those dismissed as ‘loners,’ ‘freaks,’ or ‘weirdo’s’ may have to contend with. It’s also surprising considering just how many peoplehave already used such games or services without a second thought. One industry that isn’t backing down is the sex industry. If relationships between man-and-machine may be murky waters not many want to tread, many are already jumping right into the pool of how robots could change the need for old-fashioned ‘relations…’ “When you are thirteen, you spend all your time imagining what it would be like to live in a world where you could pay a robot for sex. And that sex would cost a dollar. And the only obstacle to getting that sex would be making sure you had four quarters…” — Charles Yu,How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fictional Universe. “When you are thirteen, you spend all your time imagining what it would be like to live in a world where you could pay a robot for sex. And that sex would cost a dollar. And the only obstacle to getting that sex would be making sure you had four quarters…” — Charles Yu,How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fictional Universe. — Companies and developers engaged in the art of programming sex-bots are continuing on an upward trajectory to make themnot only programmable but more realistic. The world of sex-robots has emerged from private novelties into an industry that might invade not only brothels but even Amsterdam’s Red Light District. With sex tourism changing, the use of virtual companions instead of real ones could do anything frompreventing the spread of STD’s to cutting down on human trafficking.What sounds like a hard pitch is instead developing into the preferred road for those involved in managing such trades. If this eventually develops into a norm, then the question of whetherthis is a form of cheating arises. The more that robots are programmed to look, think, and feel like humans, then the more one needs to talk with their real-life-relationships about how they think and feel about this notion. Let alone any talk ofhow-far-is-too-farin terms of AI programming, a question some couples may have to face is how they’d react to being caught with a bot. If the robots aren’t even used as a real-life substitute but just something ‘for fun’ or ‘novelty,’ should it be considered a new social norm? “…then you grow up and it turns out you do live in that kind of world. A world with coin-operated sexbots. And it’s not really as great as you thought it would be.” — Charles Yu,How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fiction Universe. “…then you grow up and it turns out you do live in that kind of world. A world with coin-operated sexbots. And it’s not really as great as you thought it would be.” — Charles Yu,How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fiction Universe. — Regardless of how prevalence digital companionship becomes in the decades to come, there are two big questions we must ask ourselves. 1. Are we willing to tolerate the notion that others may find satisfying relationships with digital companions? 2. Are we willing to accept the fact that we might do the same? It may be evident that certain personality types are drawn to digital companionship over real ones. Regardless of how real the romance is engineered, for those not already sent down the rabbit hole of obtaining the ‘perfect mate,’ there will be little doubt you may come across a friend or family member who ends up choosing this direction or dabbling in what it offers. Who knows… …you may end up being one of them.",Samuel Carlton,https://medium.com/@twentythirtyfree/who-switched-the-dating-game-from-life-to-monopoly-6becee638515,1,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6sHTO4bIbWJhS086lLj-lg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*6sHTO4bIbWJhS086lLj-lg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*6sHTO4bIbWJhS086lLj-lg.jpeg,2019-01-03T14:48:29.739Z,Medium

It’s the last day, ever, that we can use a metropass on the Toronto Transit system. From January 1 2019, the Presto electronic payment system takes over, and that means that our ability to travel by bus or subway through the city untracked has radically decreased. We could buy a metropass with cash, use it every day all month by showing it to a fare collector, and no record that connected us with that card would be created. Not so with Presto. Presto, now in operation in Greater Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa transit systems, is developing a reputation as the system we love to hate. But the gripes you hear floating around about the switch from pass to Presto are focused on the fact that the Presto system is plagued with dysfunctional card readers, auto-fill errors that leave riders unexpectedly out of funds, and vending machines that are better at taking money than spitting out new cards. These are all irritating, but they’re likely to get fixed over time. The big issue that we’re not talking much about at all is privacy — when Presto becomes the only option, anonymous travel becomes pretty much impossible.

In fact,teams are using innovative serverless data lakes to fuel their data analytics efforts using tools like Tableau. Note: If you are wondering “what is a data lake?”, you can start with our post on the topic. While promising, we knowbuilding data lakecan seem like a daunting proposition. It is difficult to understand exactly what is needed to get started given all the different, and sometimes costly, options that exist in the market. We are going to describe a serverless solution stack of Amazon S3, Apache Parquet, and Amazon Athena for your data lake. This approach meansno infrastructure to build or manage. You also do not need to worry about configuration, software updates, failures, or scaling your infrastructure as your datasets and number of users grow. This will free your team to focus on use cases of data consumption via tools like Tableau, not the underlying system development. When teams can realize “quick wins”, they can build the confidence needed to establish organizational velocity. This allows teams the ability to explore creating, low cost, low-risk data lakes that allow them to focus on having data at the ready for analysis, reporting, or other business activity. Using AWS offers a number of benefits when creating a serverless stack: Athena is easy to query:Amazon Athena usesPresto, an open-source, distributed SQL query engine created by Facebook. It was optimized for low latency, ad hoc analysis of data. This means you can run queries against large datasets in Amazon S3 using SQL and a wide variety of BI tools like Tableau and Microsoft Power BI. Athena and S3 are cost-efficient by design:With Amazon Athena, you pay only for the queries that you run. You are charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query on S3. You can realizesignificant cost savings and performance gains by compressing, partitioning, and converting your data to Apache Parquetbecause it reduces the amount of data that Athena needs to scan to execute a query. Convenience with performance:With Amazon Athena and S3, you don’t have to worry aboutmanaging or tuning clusters to get fast performance. Athena is optimized for fast performance with Amazon S3. Combined with data in Apache Parquet format, Athena will efficiently and automatically execute queries in parallel across your data in S3. This will deliver query results in seconds, even on large datasets. Built-in durability and availability:Using Amazon S3 as the underlying data store ensures your data is highly available and durable. Amazon S3 provides a durable infrastructure for the durability of 99.999999999%. Your data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities and multiple devices in each facility. Peace of mind and a huge time saver. Secure:Access to data is controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, access control lists (ACLs), and Amazon S3 bucket policies. With IAM policies, you can grant fine-grained control to your S3 buckets. By controlling access to data in S3, you can restrict users from querying it in Athena. Athena also allows you to easily query encrypted data stored in Amazon S3 and write encrypted results back to your S3 bucket. Both, server-side encryption and client-side encryption are supported. If you wanted to get started with a data lake but did not have the time or expertise, we have a solution for you. We offer a pre-built data lake automatically handles kickstarting your efforts. Creating a private, powerful data lake is perfect for those wanting to get exposure to this type of approach without dealing with technical complexities of architecture, design, systems operations, and infrastructure. Our service optimizes and automates the configuration, processing, and loading of data to your private Amazon data lake. Not only do you get the benefits of Amazon S3 and Athena, but a fully automated, efficient, and optimized data pipelines: Automaticpartitioningof data— With data partitioning, we optimize the amount of data scanned by each query, thus improving performance and reducing the cost of data stored in S3 as you run queries Automatic conversion toApache Parquet— We convert data into an efficient and optimized open-source columnar format, Apache Parquet. This lowers costs when you execute queries as the Parquet files columnar format are highly optimized for interactive query services like Athena Automatic data compression— With data in Apache Parquet compression is performed column by column using Snappy, which means not only supports query optimizations, it reduces the size of the data stored in your Amazon S3 bucket which reduces costs Automated database and table creation— As upstream data changes,we automatically version tables and views. Data is analyzed and the system “trained” to infer schemas to automate the creation of database, views, and tables in the Athena No coding required— Using the Openbridge web interface, users can create and configure an Amazon data lake using S3, IAM, and AWS Athena This means you can focus onusing the data, not managing, building, and deploying infrastructure. We know it is not always easy to kickstart a data lake effort in a self-service world. This is why we advocate the use of pre-built data lakes for pilots or proofs-of-concept. What better way to demonstrate how you can use a data lake than to demonstrate how it is helping your team avoid unnecessarily wasting valuable human resources likeanalysts, engineers or data scientistsundertaking manualdata wranglingefforts. We have launched a code-free, zero-admin, fully automated data pipeline that automates database, table creation, Parquet file conversion, Snappy compression, partitioning, and more.

This is also your chance tonominate a topicfor discussion next month. December was a remarkably light news month, but our wonderful media outlets came to the rescue by Frankensteining together a batch of “2018 recap” articles, most of which exclaimed that autonomous tech had faltered during the past year by highlighting the death of Elaine Herzberg and then tossing in some garbage material as filler. The sentiment is pretty far from the truth, but we know the public prefers stories over facts and logic, so that’s what you get from publications that get paid to grab you by the eyeballs. As a counterpoint, I’ll offer a brief recap of my year’s more notable editorials. May you go into 2019 a wiser person, or at least riddled with self-doubt: Why It’s So Difficult To Compare Man And Machine Why There Is No Clear Distinction Between Conventional Cars And Autonomous Cars Why Self-Driving Vehicles Won’t Outperform Humans Why Driverless Cars Don’t Need To Prevent A Single Crash Federal Legislation (AV START Act) Stalls Out In…",Mitch Turck,https://medium.com/@mitchturck/state-of-autonomy-november-recap-259668d23aa1,15,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*VQdZOdvO0nJ1MXiGbfksUQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*VQdZOdvO0nJ1MXiGbfksUQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*VQdZOdvO0nJ1MXiGbfksUQ.jpeg,2019-01-20T13:55:31.061Z,Medium

https://medium.com/the-habitual-programmer/the-habitual-programmer-42c013153088?source=tag_archive---------105-----------------------,The Habitual Programmer,Where is a Habitual Programmer?,"AAYUSH JAIN Follow The Habitual Programmer -- Listen Share Where is a Habitual Programmer? Habitual Programmers are a rare breed and are only found in places which fulfil two criteria — availability of high-speed internet and the lack of human interaction. They are almost always accompanied by their best friend — their laptop! All throughout history, there have been numerous search operations to find these rare, mysterious creatures. The desire for a peaceful environment has forced these entities to hide in the dark corners of the world. So, these habitual programmers are now considered to be nothing but mythical creatures found only in the virtual dimension. Okay. Now if you believed any of that and are probably thinking that you can never be a habitual programmer (or perhaps if you’re thinking of how foolish this all sounds), here’s some good news — Habitual Programmers are all around you. You can find them in your class in the form of that classmate who completes his programming assignment without fail. You can find them in your office in the form of that colleague who is always on the lookout to learn new programming concepts. Heck, you can even find them in your nearby park enjoying the beauty of nature (and perhaps thinking about how to debug their code). To cut to the chase — they are everywhere! “I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits.”―Kent Beck “I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits.”―Kent Beck Who is a Habitual Programmer? Before describing who is a Habitual Programmer, let us understand what is a habit. Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day. To in other words, a habit is a routine or a behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. Now, a Programmer is someone who is not only capable of writing code or building and designing software, but someone who desires to learn about new techniques, has the ability to think outside the box, knows how to communicate effectively while not compromising on his physical and mental well-being. Thus, a Habitual Programmer is simply a person that relies on small achievable habits to constantly improve his programming proficiency. A Habitual Programmer is successful not because he is a programming genius but because the accumulative effect of his small habits morphed him into an individual capable of achieving massive results. I’ll do you one better-Why is a Habitual Programmer? Last year, my New Year’s Resolution was to improve as a Programmer. I started the year with my fuel tank filled with motivation. For the first week, I did everything-I started doing projects, started taking MOOCs and started going to meetups. Everything went great for the first week. The following weeks were a disaster as I felt exhausted and gave up on my resolution altogether. Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. This year, with the experiences of last year, I have again decided to embark on this journey of improving as a programmer. If you’re on the same boat and want to improve as a programmer, remember thatimprovement is a marathon and not a 100m sprint and you cannot expect to keep moving ahead with motivation as the sole fuel to push you forward. Habits are what you do repeatedly. These repeated actions mould your identity as a Programmer and as you start feeling more confident about your skills, the more likely you are to continue on the journey of improvement. If you ever think that Programming is difficult or that you are not meant for this field, you will appreciate the concept of Habitual Programming. You will see that with deliberate practice and minor adjustments in your behaviours to remove the bad habits and replace them with good habits, you will soon be able to exponentially increase your programming skills. ThroughThe Habitual Programmer, I wish to help you build the necessary habits to slowly but significantly improve your programming skills. Small habits aimed at bringing about a 1% increase in your proficiency could compound over time to bring massive change. After all,we are a product of our habits. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.",AAYUSH JAIN,https://medium.com/@patni.aayush1998?source=post_page---byline--42c013153088---------------------------------------,3,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*vcURCCTpgpPjrEToFJrD5g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*vcURCCTpgpPjrEToFJrD5g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*vcURCCTpgpPjrEToFJrD5g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png,2019-01-03T16:55:26.186Z,Medium

In 2017, our work was hardly an idea. We are now months away from launching, and have built a supportive network of amazing colleagues, mentors, advisors, business partners, investors, and most importantly advocates who champion the work our team is doing. We’re tackling the opioid crisis with our flagship serviceNaloxone Exchange, an online marketplace where anyone can purchase the life-saving opioid antidoteNaloxone, receive effective training on how to use it, and have it delivered to their door. In short, this medication is a miracle drug that gives people a second shot at life. In fact, its brand (Narcan) made byAdapt Pharmais the same drug that has revived thousands of people, including celebrity musicianDemi Lovato. When72,000 people diefrom a preventable condition, smart and thoughtful action needs to be taken. Our company,Fiduscriptaims to make it easy for anyone in the United States (from law enforcement to worried parents, and everyone in between) to order Naloxone and have it delivered to their door seamlessly. I’d like to take a few moments to highlight some of the incredible things that happened to us this past year.

Edit: follow-up post (with the $ offered) postedhere! Followmy Twitterfor future updates :) Levels.fyi now offers aprofessional negotiation serviceif you’re looking for help from actual recruiters (I’ve attached my affiliate link). All of the below is heavily inspired bythis post from last yearthat originally pushed me to consider the possibility of moving companies. I didn’t want to fly across the country repeatedly to find my perfect job, so I knew I had to schedule them alongside each other and gut it out. While the roles I was specifically pursuing were mobile positions,the study approach, tips, and recommendations should be universal. Hopefully, I can inspire people that were in the same spot as me — not 100% happy with work, dreaming of life in the Bay, but lacking severely on the “study prep” front — to just go for it and see what the future brings their way. I knewI wanted a job in the Bay Area where I could really grow from a mobile perspective at a larger company. I’ve worked at startups before and I’ve loved it, but for a few reasons, I was looking at the big fish this go-around (in terms of valuation, not strictly team size). I also knew that I wasn’t positive where I wanted to work or how much compensation I’d need to match what I’m making now. Ialsoknew I didn’t want to apply to 100+ places like I did when I was graduating from college. All told,I applied to 20 companies. I wasexplicitly rejected by 4of those companies (Reddit, Nest, Stripe, Uber) after applying. Of the remaining 16,10 companies never respondedto me either way (Lyft, Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube, Square, Robinhood, Twitter, Snap, Slack). Math dictates6 companies followed up with a recruiter screen. Of those 6 companies, I was able to getphone screens with 6,onsites with 6, andoffers from 6. Reviewing my Google Calendar, I believe I had (approximately): 7 recruiter screens in 10 days 7 technical screens in 11 days 29 onsite interviews in 8 days 3 follow-up phone interviews Adding up the above saysI had 46 interviews in 73 days(including gaps between each step). It was exhausting and it meant that most of my lunch breaks were just interviews for multiple weeks. I had to start going into work very early so I could leave earlier to take calls at home. Making sure I was still meeting all of my commitments at work was a challenge, too, but I made sure to prioritize that over interviewing, rescheduling when necessary. I wouldn’t phone it in for the purposes of interviewing. It makes you look bad, it’s unethical, and if you don’t get a job, you’re now a lower performer. LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, CA) LinkedIn’s mobile apps are actually pretty slick and they have somesolid contributionsto the open source community. I was very impressed throughout the entire interview process with LinkedIn from both a culture perspective and an engineering perspective. They rose the highest on my mental list of iOS Prestige™ from the start of the process until the end. Yelp (San Francisco, CA) Yelp has a really beautiful app with tons of iOS subtleties that show an understanding of the platform. I loved the vibe onsite. They have a beautiful building and I’d love to work with any of my interviewers. They’re much smaller than any of the other companies I applied to and it showed in all of the good ways. It seemed very tight knit and the process movedfast. Apple (Cupertino, CA) Apple’s been an important part of iOS for a while (har har). I grew up an extreme Apple fanboy (since the age of 12, at least). The Mac originally got me into programming. The iPhone SDK encouraged me to build and ship my first app. It was absolutely surreal to have them invite me onsite and later extend me an offer. I don’t know what else there is to say on that front. Amazon (Palo Alto, CA) I wouldn’t consider Amazon a “mobile-first” as a company (at all). This position/team, though, met the criteria I laid out to start. I wasn’t in love with the Palo Alto building I was in specifically, but it’s a temporary office until they move into a more Amazon-y building, so it’s mostly poor interview timing on that front. The people I spoke to seemed pretty dedicated to their product. Although every company loved telling me that “it really feels like a startup!”, it rang the truest at Amazon. Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) I interviewed Facebook’s newest building. I thought it was really cool overall, although I’m somewhat hazy on the details about how the interview itself went because I was on my fifth consecutive day of interviewing with inadequate sleep. I do remember really enjoying the people I spoke with and having a very insightful lunch interview. Google (Mountain View, CA) Google, to my understanding, does pretty “generic” interviews for a given role. I spoke to a lot of members from one of Google’s biggest products on iOS, but I wasn’t interviewing for a position specifically with that team. After I passed through Google’s hiring committee I moved on to the team matching phase and ultimately matched up with a team. It’s a veryloooooongprocess relative to the rest of the companies I spoke with, so I definitely had to keep everyone updated on where Google was. I also had to let Google know where I was with everyone else. To be clear, I was starting from a position where I could probably do most Leetcode Easy problems in ~30 minutes, and I could maybe solve 25% of Leetcode Medium problems with infinite time. Solving Leetcode Hard problems were akin to trying to solve P=NP. In short, I had a large gap to bridge. To study algorithmsI began first withCracking the Coding Interview. On Sunday mornings I’d wake up and go to acoffee shopand grind out some problems in Objective-C. Once I did enough problems in CtCI (I think I solved ~35 problems) I would review a handful of Leetcode problems in the chapters I’d gone over. After a few weeks of this, I felt I had “the basics” down and moved on to my next phase. With the basics down,I moved on toElements of Programming Interviews. This book isconsiderablymore difficult than CtCI. The book has recommended study plans that I stuck pretty closely with. I think there was one that planned on four weeks of studying and I got through almost all of it.It is critical, in my opinion, to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone. Not critical as in “very important”, but critical as inyou should consider it an absolute requirement when studying. I’m sure you can get a job without it, but it’s the single best form of practice I had. If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me onCS Career Hackersand maybe we can work something out, time permitting. If not me, there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward.That’s the point. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you?If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing.It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off. After about a month of consistently practicing problems each day (maybe 2–3 hours/day, more on weekends) I moved on to doing primarily Leetcode’s “Top Interview Questions”. I didn’t do them all but I did “enough”.The key to preparing algorithm interviews is to get yourself to a point that you can figure out a problem during the interview,not necessarily to know how to do every problem. That’s impossible. Almost all of the questions I heard over my week of onsites were “new” to me yet similar to questions I’d seen. That’s how most development goes in the industry, too. You have a lot of similar problems but your particular use case has special constraints. I’m going to present a bunch of lessons I learned as bullet points in no particular order. Everything listed below is something I wish I knew beforehand, both in terms of preparation on the technical side and in terms of scheduling and other non-technical tips.These lessons are not iOS-specific and I’d imagine are generally applicable to all interviews in our industry. 📚Stick with it.When I was looking for a job out of school I gave up after one or two weeks of studying. I reasoned that I simply was not cut out to learn the stuff. There was minimal progress from when I first started for weeks, so what was the point of wasting any more time? This time around, I figured I didn’t have a choice. Eventually, things started falling into place. It’s a lot of work, but the willingness to learn is what separates successful candidates from the rest. 🤓 Practice isalmosteverything.You certainly need a baseline of innate ability, but practice (i.e. learning) can fill inverywide ability gaps. Companies don’t hire people based on the knowledge they were born with. They hire those that can perform their duties and perform them well, regardless of where/when they cultivated the knowledge. 👫 Practicing with a friend is everythingelse.Whether on a whiteboard or on something likeCodeshare, simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before, as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously, that kind of practice isinvaluable. 📊 It’s a numbers game.You can practice — effectively, even — and not land a job because the right person didn’t see your resumé or you just didn’t see a solution to a whiteboard problem in time. The best you can hope to do is maximize your odds. This means applying everywhere you would like to work and fit a job req and not just your top choice. I applied for my top 20! 🤔 Focus on the problem solving, not the solution.Memorization isn’t enough. Of ~20 algorithm problems I saw in a week I had seen maybe one of the problems before (and I let my interviewer know, though many would disagree with that choice). I just saw lots of common patterns and I was able to come up with solutions on the fly. 😣 Don’t get discouraged.There were multiple interviews I had where I didn’t know the solution and interviewers had to shepherd me towards a solution. I still got offers from everywhere I interviewed. Also, I felt I absolutelybombedone of my interviews (four of my five that day I thought were solid “no hires”) and the company later extended me an offer. Anything can happen, evidently. :) 🤯 Don’t be quick to disregard problems.There were multiple times I was practicing with a friend of mine and he shrugged off particularly difficult problems as pointless to know. Curiously enough, of the four types of problems I recall him saying would “never” come up, two of them did. Not in theexactform we were going to practice, but very similar. If your practice shows a certain concept come up frequently, learn it. 🧐 Don’t underestimate the importance of behavioral questions. I think I enjoyed a lot of success because my (honest) answers were what companies wanted. It’s my theory that many developers have strong technical skills and still struggle to find their perfect job because they’re rude, dishonest, or uncomfortable speaking to people outside of a technical setting. These are all justifiable reasons to reject a candidate, in my opinion. Practice them just as you would technical questions. 🧠 If you know more, show it.There were multiple examples during my onsites where I would answer a question and mention some other knowledge I had but explain that I didn’t have time in an interview to fully implement that solution. Answering a question about strings? Show off your Unicode knowledge with your solution or explain how to support Unicode. Implementing a private method? Talk about the Objective-C conventions for methods. Updating a table view? Talk about the different animations you can support. Don’t bring something up if you can’t talk all about it, but if you can, it allows you to show knowledge outside of the narrow window provided by the question and gives you a leg up on anyone that sticks strictly to the beaten path. 💪 Don’t strive to clear the bar, strive to set it.Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company, but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer, that’s great. But keep in mind there’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter! My initial (i.e. not negotiated) offers came in pretty solid despite my relative lack of experience and I believe interview performance played a big role. So that’s that! It was a crazy ride and I have no regrets. I truly, genuinely hope that the above can help someone get over the hump when it comes to landing a job they’ve dreamed about. If there’s particular interest in iOS-specific help, I can publish some tips, so please comment and let me know. If it’s of any use: I was interviewing for my second job out of college with about two and a half years of experience without any particularly notable internships or employers on my resume; I went to a very small school that had zero known software companies at their “career fair”; I started preparing in late April and started applying in June/July; and, lastly, a few months in, my job is everything I could have possibly dreamed of. I’d like to shout out theCS Career Hackerscommunity one last time.If you’re looking for a place to practice and talk with others in similar situations (or those that have been through it on either side), please do check it out. 👍 I didn’t find it until a few months after I signed my offer, but it’s a great place nonetheless. Happy studying, everyone! ok, technically, it was six weekdays and eight days; no, I didn’t interview on a Saturday :) 📝 Read this story later inJournal. 👩‍💻 Wake up every Sunday morning to the week’s most noteworthy stories in Tech waiting in your inbox.Read the Noteworthy in Tech newsletter.",Bay Area Bell,https://medium.com/@XiaohanZeng/i-interviewed-at-five-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-five-days-and-luckily-got-five-job-offers-25178cf74e0f,13955,11 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*w7i0Xwv-32W8Nk9bbH5tXQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*w7i0Xwv-32W8Nk9bbH5tXQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*w7i0Xwv-32W8Nk9bbH5tXQ.jpeg,2020-11-26T20:26:55.292Z,Medium

VVPATs are currently being used as a mere tool to fool us.",VVPAT stands for Voter verifiable paper audit trail,"Unnikrishnan Follow -- Listen Share “If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them. That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.”Dr. B.R.Ambedkar (in his last speech to the Constituent Assembly) “If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them. That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.” Dr. B.R.Ambedkar (in his last speech to the Constituent Assembly) Summary VVPAT’s purpose is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded votes correctly. So proper audit with an adequate sample size is the essential aspect of using VVPATs and without proper audit VVPAT may become just a tool to fool voters giving them a false sense of verifiability & scrutiny. ECI has not been carrying out proper audit or even its July 2017 decision of 5% audit in the elections in last one and a half years. And if mismatch is detected in the arbitrary miniscule audit of 1 booth/constituencyECI EVM VVPAT manual July 2018doesn’t even have a direction or clause to do/allow the necessitated full VVPAT audit . ECI has also vehemently opposed several cases by various parties in courts requesting for proper audit. Courts have evaded responsibility by leaving discretion to ECI & has failed to make ECI accountable. Mainstream media have remained silent even on grave issues like mass voter deletion & widespread mismatch in votes counted & polled suggesting EVM error/rigging in elections. In such an environment in which the Elections with EVM VVPAT technology is made unaccountable , the transparent & time tested Paper ballots must be preferred. Use of EVM VVPAT should not be allowed without proper , statistically sound audit & election rule for necessitated full VVPAT tally on mismatch in sample audit. Merely focusing on EVM ban has allowed grave issues of EVM VVPAT use to go unnoticed & unquestioned. VVPAT stands for Voter verifiable paper audit trail The purpose of VVPAT is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded & reproduced votes correctly. This audit checks whether the results from EVM are correct & the election is valid. The purpose of VVPAT is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded & reproduced votes correctly. This audit checks whether the results from EVM are correct & the election is valid. A Voter checks at the time of voting whether the paper record of his vote is correct by verifying the VVPAT printout. The check whether the vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM is done by tallying aka auditing an adequate & statistically sound sample of this VVPAT slips. VVPAT Mismatch means the votes recorded by VVPAT & EVM don’t tally. This is definite evidence of EVM error or EVM rigging. So if any mismatch occurs in the representative sample audited, it suggests that the results by EVM counting in the constituency is wrong & hence a full 100% VVPAT count of all booths of the constituency is essential to find the people’s mandate or result. The most important elements of a valid audit are adequate sample size , transparent & independent randomization & full VVPAT tally on any mismatch. (Describing more on VVPAT here as most voters & even political party leaders doesn’t seem to have enough info about VVPAT, Significance of proper randomization , Meaning of mismatch & Necessity of full audit on mismatch — This also shows why paper ballots are much preferred. ) ECI currently only allows VVPAT audit of 1 booth /constituency. In most constituencies this comes to about 0.4% of VVPATs used. For example in Gujarat election there were 50128 booths for 182 constituencies. So about 0.36%. aka 182/50128 booths were allowed to be audited there. And on detecting VVPAT mismatchECI’s EVM VVPAT manual(Please read the full manual-ECI site—Archived file) doesn’t have a clause or rule for the necessitated full audit of all the booths of the constituency. Yes you read that right . There is no clause or rule for full audit on mismatch in the election manual. This defeats the very purpose of VVPAT audit (even on a proper sample size) & makes VVPAT a mere tool to fool voters. Yes you read that right . There is no clause or rule for full audit on mismatch in the election manual. This defeats the very purpose of VVPAT audit (even on a proper sample size) & makes VVPAT a mere tool to fool voters. Current rule on detecting mismatch is clause 56D(4)(b) , That is to accept the VVPAT tally instead of EVM tally in that booth with mismatch . There is no provision or rule to do/allow full VVPAT audit of all booths of constituency to detect peoples mandate which has been shown(by mismatch in sample) to be wrongly recorded by the EVM. There are different types of election result audits like fixed percentage random sampling, fixed number random sampling, risk limiting audit etc. Risk limiting audit sample sizes will depend on several factors and may vary from constituency to constituency & is done in stages . So it may make the election process further opaque to a population mostly clueless about EVM & VVPAT. So a fixed percentage/number audit across constituencies seems more adequate for India. In context of General elections 2019 , this article“Transparent use of statistical methods can help detect rigged electronic voting machines”by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata)facultydiscusses the statistics on percentage of VVPATs to be audited. This analysis by ISI faculty tells the following “Let us take four different possibilities of level of potential rigging into account at the constituency level: 25%, 10%, 5% and 0.5%. We assume an equal distribution of 1.8 million EVMs across 543 constituencies. Tallying 11, 29, 58 and 534 V-VPATs per constituency would allow us to find a rigged EVM with 95% probability for each of these four scenarios.” This is after considering 1.8 million evms for General election that is about 3314 EVM/VVPATs per each of 543 constituencies. This analysis by ISI faculty tells the following “Let us take four different possibilities of level of potential rigging into account at the constituency level: 25%, 10%, 5% and 0.5%. We assume an equal distribution of 1.8 million EVMs across 543 constituencies. Tallying 11, 29, 58 and 534 V-VPATs per constituency would allow us to find a rigged EVM with 95% probability for each of these four scenarios.” This is after considering 1.8 million evms for General election that is about 3314 EVM/VVPATs per each of 543 constituencies. So if there is 15 lakhs votes per constituency, to detect a rigging of upto 7500 votes with 95% probability we need an audit of 534/3314 (about 16%) VVPATs per constituency. Hence we need an VVPAT audit of at least 16 % to ensure the validity of an election won with 0.5% margin that is 7500 votes.(approximately) Next important aspect of audit after adequate sample size will be transparent & independent randomization . If process of randomisation is compromised the sample of VVPATs selected can be made non representative of the constituency being audited. So after having an adequate sample size the randomization procedure in the selection of that sample must be transparent & must ideally be done by a party not directly responsible for conduct of election . Most importantly Full VVPAT tally of all booths of the constituency in case of mismatch( in the sample audited) is what allows the audit to correct the wrong results shown by the EVM. This Full VVPAT tally ensures the people’s mandate prevails over the EVM mandate. This Full VVPAT tally ensures the people’s mandate prevails over the EVM mandate. Without this full VVPAT tally VVPAT/sample audit serves no purpose & only helps in deceiving voters. After SC intervention on delay in implementation of VVPATs, On May 12 2017 ECI made this press release titled — “Meeting of all Political Parties on issues related to EVM/VVPAT and other Electoral reforms” ( after upgrade the new ECI website doesn’t have link to the old press releases). In it ECI said “The Commission will count V-VPAT slips up to a definite percentage, which will be determined by the Commission. The ECI will be shortly evolving an appropriate framework in this regard.”On July 6, 2017 IndianExpress(IE) reported on the front page“EC to tally paper trail slips with EVMs in 5% booths in each assembly seat”, the article also had details on how the 5% VVPAT audit decision was reached. In it ECI said “The Commission will count V-VPAT slips up to a definite percentage, which will be determined by the Commission. The ECI will be shortly evolving an appropriate framework in this regard.” On July 6, 2017 IndianExpress(IE) reported on the front page“EC to tally paper trail slips with EVMs in 5% booths in each assembly seat”, the article also had details on how the 5% VVPAT audit decision was reached. The article also said “The decision on compulsory counting of paper trail slips, which was approved by the full Commission before Nasim Zaidi retired as the Chief Election Commissioner on Wednesday, is a response to the demand made by political parties at a meeting held by the EC on May 12.” Inspite of this 5% audit decision — On October 10, 2017 Indian express published report titled“Will compare VVPAT paper slips in one polling station of all 182 assembly constituencies: CEC on Gujarat polls” On December 7, 2017 hearing a petition on use of VVPATs & request for VVPAT audit in Gujarat Elections, Gujarat HC ordered — “Even though we are not inclined to accept the petitioner’s suggestion of full manual counting of votes, to inquire from the EC, whether any framework for sample counting of VVPAT slips along with EVM votes on random basis bas been set up or not.” In this December 8,2017 IE report (Gujarat elections: High Court notice to EC on counting of VVPAT slips) on the above December 7 Gujarat HC order it is reported that “The EC, however, opposed the petition claiming that EVMs are tamper-proof and paper trail can’t be counted.” On December 8,2017 after the December 7 Gujarat HC order enquiring about framework for VVPAT audit ECI madepress release telling VVPAT audit of 1 booth/constituency will be done. ( after upgrade the new ECI website doesn’t have link to the old press releases) December 7, 2017 Gujarat HC order can be accessedhere& final Gujarat HC order on December 12here On December 1 ,2018 Economic times published this report —‘After ISI report, EC to decide on raising polling stations where VVPAT slips matched with results’ This comes about one and a half year after, not carrying out 5% VVPAT audit decision & conducting several state elections without proper audit which essentially makes the elections invalid. In it then CEC tells ECI have asked ISI for a report on how much should be the sample size( of VVPATs audited) “for 99.99 per cent confidence level with near zero error” In it then CEC tells ECI have asked ISI for a report on how much should be the sample size( of VVPATs audited) “for 99.99 per cent confidence level with near zero error” This sounds promising, but can well be an attempt of further deception. As can be seen from analysis above by faculty from same ISI , we seem to need a sample size or VVPAT audit of more than 16% for this 99.99% confidence level with near zero error. Coming from ECI that has not done any meaningful audit & doesn’t even have a provision for full audit on mismatch this said upcoming ISI report(if it comes) has to be watched carefully. It was said in the Newsreport that the ISI report will come after recent five state elections are over. The said ISI report needs to be in public domain well before notification of General Elections 2019 , so that political parties & voters may study & respond to the adequate sample size suggested by the ISI report .(If EVM/VVPAT is used in General Elections) On October 24,2017 petition was filed in SC by All India Congress Committee (AICC) Secretary Prakash Joshi, seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to frame appropriate rules, regulations and guidelines for the counting of VVPAT paper trails. On October 30,2017 SC bench of CJI,Justice A.M. Khanwilkar , Justice D.Y. Chandrachud disposed off the petition wp(c) 983/2017 citing “As far as Prayer (b) is concerned, it is urged by Mr. K.K. Venugopal that guidelines have already been brought by the Election Commission of India. The same is disputed by Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr. Vivek Tankha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner. We leave it to the discretion of the Election Commission of India, as we are not inclined to enter into the said arena.” “As far as Prayer (b) is concerned, it is urged by Mr. K.K. Venugopal that guidelines have already been brought by the Election Commission of India. The same is disputed by Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr. Vivek Tankha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner. We leave it to the discretion of the Election Commission of India, as we are not inclined to enter into the said arena.” (This case happened before Gujarat HC intervened(December 7,2017 HC order as above) in the matter. By intervening Gujarat HC ensured ECI atleast does the token arbitrary audit of 1 booth/constituency. But later Gujarat HC also followed this SC Judgement.) The SC order can be accessedhere On November 20, 2017 same SC bench dismissed wp(c) 1012/2017 petition requesting removal of clause 56(D)(2) of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 , which leaves decision to recount by VVPAT to the sole discretion of Returning Officer. The order can be accessedhere On December 15, 2017 Secretary, Gujarat Pradesh Congress made plea in SC to cross-verify 25% VVPAT-EVM votes in State polls. SC bench of Justices CJI, A.M Khanwilkar & D Y Chandrachud refused plea making some oral observations (see this newsreport) “Do you have any cogent material to show us that the EC’s decision was taken arbitrarily? We can only exercise our judicial powers after positively concluding that EC has exercise its powers arbitrarily.We have to be slow in a case when the EC has already taken a decision, How can we discredit a process?” The arbitrariness of ECI decision to audit 1 booth/constituency or about 0.36% of VVPATs & the need for statistically significant audit was not brought up by the petitioners counsel. Petitioner’s counsel also failed to bring to SC’s notice the July 2017 decision of ECI on 5% VVPAT audit. Neither was proper & statistically sound audit, stressed as necessary part of people’s voting rights.

This safeguard is provided notwithstanding the the “one-booth formula” directed by the EC.” (quoting from the report) Same bench had dismissed petition(as can be seen above) seeking amends to clause leaving the decision of recount by VVPAT to the sole discretion of Returning Officer. This right of candidates to ask for recount with VVPAT is almost never allowed by returning officer .For example recounting with VVPAT on request was allowed only in 2 of the 50128 booths in Gujarat Elections.(See here) . This right of candidates to ask for recount with VVPAT is almost never allowed by returning officer .For example recounting with VVPAT on request was allowed only in 2 of the 50128 booths in Gujarat Elections.(See here) . On October 12, 2018 SC bench of Justice A K Sikri & Justice Bhushan dismissed petition by Kamal Nath seeking 10% of randomized VVPAT audit & to provide electoral rolls in text format to detect deletion of voters & other pleas regarding electoral roll manipulation . The bench depended on past SC orders dismissing pleas for VVPAT audit which had left discretion to ECI . “In view of the orders dated October 30, 2017 passed in W.P.c No 983 of 2017 and on the basis of statement given by the ECI in the Court, we do not intend to entertain this relief” Read the full judgement here Several lakhs of voters were deleted by ECI from voter list by linking aadhaar “voluntarily”(EC to Link Aadhaar-Voter ID? It Already Did So Without Our Consent) in several states . In Telengana this amounted to about 22 lakh people or about 8% of electorate(Mass deletion of voter names reported in Telangana polls). ECI did almost nothing to correct this deletions & even didn’t allow request of opposition parties to postpone election(Deletion of 30 lakh Hyderabad voters worries Election Commission) to allow time for correction of voter deletions. ECI did almost nothing to correct this deletions & even didn’t allow request of opposition parties to postpone election(Deletion of 30 lakh Hyderabad voters worries Election Commission) to allow time for correction of voter deletions. After Disenfranchisement of lakhs of Indians Telengana CEO “Apologised”!. (‘Sorry, will take special measures next time’: Telangana CEO apologises to Jwala Gutta, others for missing voters names) Then on January 1, 2019 EC went on to announce dates for Telengana panchayat elections (Rural polls to be held in three phases) without rectifying the mass voter deletion. New CEC had this to say when enquired about Telengana incident in this interview (We have zero per cent tolerance for malpractice, says CEC Sunil Arora) - “On Telangana, it is very ironical that ever since these technology platforms have come into the electoral rolls, whatever the manual issues used to be, the mistakes that were not detected, are now getting detected.We have ERONet on a pan-India basis. So, in Telangana, the same people complained to the Hyderabad High Court. We gave our side of the picture and the petition was dismissed. (contd)” Then in the same interview he went on to tell one of his major agenda is to make the electoral roles Purer. In another report(Up to 15% of voters left out of rolls, without even a fair hearing) on astudy done by EPW in Karnatakatells “ Up to 15% of the total electorate of around 130 million adult citizens is missing from the electoral rolls. Data also showed a disproportionate exclusion of Muslims, and pointed to the possibility of similar exclusion among marginalised castes.” The report goes on to further tell “Out of 2.8 lakh new applications for enrolment during 2017–18, a high 62% were rejected — as many as 18% were denied on the ground of not being Indian citizens and 24% for unspecified reasons. To put it more dramatically, among the total number of rejects, around 30% were rejected on the ground of not being Indian citizens and 39% for reasons not publicly available.” In Telengana elections votes counted in several constituencies were more than votes polled, DeccanChronicle reported it on front page asTally mismatch in Telangana Assembly poll results: Are winners losers?. It was aptly referred to asElectoral mockery.This report from vijayakranthi newsshows Votes counted were significantly more than votes polled in at least 31 constituencies.

It was aptly referred to asElectoral mockery.This report from vijayakranthi newsshows Votes counted were significantly more than votes polled in at least 31 constituencies. This occuring in several constituencies points to large scale EVM error or manipulation & essentially makes election invalid. A full open immediate VVPAT audit in these constituencies was a minimum step to be taken by ECI in this serious incidence. But even withwritten request from political party representativesnothing was done by ECI. The CEO tried to refute the newspaper reports, but those attempts fell flat (CEO’s clarification on vote mismatch proves wrong). This serious incident happened after election commission refused to postpone elections as political parties pointed out issue of deletion of lakhs of voters from voter lists. This mass voter deletion & widespread EVM error/rigging was mostly not covered by the national or other state level mainstream media. This mass voter deletion & widespread EVM error/rigging was mostly not covered by the national or other state level mainstream media. On 27th December,2018 VVPAT slips were found to be removed from VVPATs in Jubilee Hills Constituency , This happened despite EC clause that printed slips must not be removed from VVPATs for 45 days after declaration of results . This points to grave misdoings & also essentially makes delayed VVPAT tallies meaningless .Read the news reporthere -Slip out: VVPAT slips go ‘missing’ in Jubilee Hills, Congress demands re-poll In Gujarat elections the headlines after election read “100% Match Between EVMs and Paper Trail Slips on Random Vote Count, Says EC Official” but the report showed there was mismatch in at least 4 seats. “There was a mismatch of some votes on one booth each of these four seats. This occurred because the Returning Officer must have made the same mistake but it could not be detected earlier. So we took into account VVPAT slips for these booths during the counting and resolved the issue,” said Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer B B Swain in the report. The mistake CEO is talking about here is the nonclearance of mockpoll . But if it was indeed mockpoll not being cleared , checking the mockpoll form tally would have solved the issue with clarity & CEO wouldn’t have to make the assumption of “RO must have made the error of not clearing mockpoll results”. Anyway currently with VVPAT mismatch even if it was not a mockpoll issue & indicated EVM error/ rigging , the returning officer will just show the election manual & tell, we have no option or rule for full VVPAT tally , so just take the favour of accepting the booth tally & live with it. So essentially no VVPAT mismatch comes out , its always a 100% match on audit.

So essentially no VVPAT mismatch comes out , its always a 100% match on audit. This report (#MadhyaPradeshElections2018: What explains the delay in counting?) from MP election tells “On the day of counting, the State Election Commission informed that the figure of such polling booths where CRC had not been removed after mock polls have increased to 175 across the state.” The curious case of increasing number of uncleared mock polls is a concern. According to EC EVM VVPAT manual returning officer have to sign a form telling mock poll results have been cleared before start of election, & this has to be verified & signed by polling agents. This high number of uncleared mock polls causes unnecessary delay in counting( as VVPAT tallying will be done in those booths) & may give counting agents a false sense of VVPAT audit which is being done on a non representative sample. Paper Ballots makes election process transparent & allows the common voter to easily understand the election process. It ensures each vote is counted by direct verification. It also allows interpretation of votes without need of technology as a middleman. Paper Ballots makes election process transparent & allows the common voter to easily understand the election process. It ensures each vote is counted by direct verification. It also allows interpretation of votes without need of technology as a middleman. Paper ballots don’t need elaborate security checks & measures as EVM VVPAT and only require secure printing & full video camera monitoring(without power cut)during poll and post poll to verify & ensure integrity of election. Only real advantages EVM may have over Paper Ballot is prevent votes being invalid & slowing ballot stuffing , that can happen during booth capturing. But with EVM, instead of booth capturing, capturing can happen at state level or a national level and can still go undetected without proper audit of adequate sample size. And after doing proper audit we need full tally on mismatch & an accountable ECI to ensure peoples mandate prevails over EVM mandate.As we saw in Telengana – (where at least in 31 constituencies votes counted were significantly more than votes polled ) - even a widespread EVM error or a badly executed EVM tampering can go undetected till the last moment of counting . Nothing has been done by the ECI to stop the results in Telengana. ECI has not even done an immediate full VVPAT tally atleast in these constituencies to detect the source of error/fraud .Courts will be slow to spring into action & usually refuses to intervene in election results.

Paper ballots will have made the error/fraud visible to public on the day of election itself. With EVM the trends of election may go wrong till last moment of counting till proper audit (if implemented) is done & the EVM results needs to be corrected based on the full audit . Hence Paper Ballots seems to be the much better option in front of a technology & system that can and has been made unaccountable. Hence Paper Ballots seems to be the much better option in front of a technology & system that can and has been made unaccountable. Only place EVM/VVPAT have some relevance is problem areas where it may help in slowing ballot stuffing in case of booth capturing as described above . The malfunction rates of VVPATs are often high & is a cause of concern. (‘Over 2,400 VVPAT machines malfunctioned’). Also there are conflicting reports of VVPATs' performance during increased heat & direct light. see these reports(Former CEC, Experts Challenge Election Commission’s Theory on VVPAT Failure,VVPAT may hit poll result) . Even ECI manual tells “Don’t allow direct light or high power illumination over VVPAT.” (Page 129). Political parties & Citizens must take a firm stand without further delay that- Paper ballots must be used at least in problem free areas. Political parties & Citizens must not go into EVM/VVPAT elections without - Proper VVPAT audit with adequate sample size — Every vote must ideally count & Time must never be a constraint in deciding peoples mandate. — At the very least we must have a VVPAT audit that is capable of detecting upto 0.5% rigging with 95% probability , which requires about 16% audit as pointed out by analysis of ISI faculty above.Election commission must implement rules or clause allowing necessitated full audit/tally of 100% VVPATs of a constituency in case of mismatch in the sample audit.

Election commission must implement rules or clause allowing necessitated full audit/tally of 100% VVPATs of a constituency in case of mismatch in the sample audit. Supreme Court can be approached but in recent cases Supreme court have failed to make ECI accountable to citizens. If cases can be presented well in the SC by professional lawyers the bench will be able to understand that a proper audit with adequate sample size & full audit on mismatch are basic part of citizen’s voting rights & are needed to ensure the elections are valid. The status of ECI’s ISI report on VVPAT sample size for “99.99% confidence level with near zero error” must be enquired. But waiting for the report to act will not be helpful. Extra adequate/set number of VVPATs must be tallied on contestants request for recount. Contestants may be allowed to pick VVPATs for this audit. (removal of notorious clause 56(D) (2),that has taken away right of candidate to ask for VVPAT tally) Extra adequate/set number of VVPATs must be tallied on contestants request for recount. Contestants may be allowed to pick VVPATs for this audit. (removal of notorious clause 56(D) (2),that has taken away right of candidate to ask for VVPAT tally) Other measures needed include Randomisation must be transparently & independently done In case VVPAT slips are not properly recorded , provision must be there for reelection if indicated by the margin. Political parties must educate election agents about — How results are invalid or not final till proper audit & full VVPAT tally( if needed )is done ,importance of randomisation, meaning of mismatch in sample audit , & the necessity of full audit on mismatch. Above all we must have an Election commission that is accountable and works for ensuring voting rights of every Indian & not one that works to disenfranchise us. Above all we must have an Election commission that is accountable and works for ensuring voting rights of every Indian & not one that works to disenfranchise us. So rather than repeating facts like any technology is hackable , We need to talk about the current scenario of Indian Elections. ECI has not been doing any meaningful audit & has not yet carried out even its July 2017 decision of 5% audit .ECI EVM VVPAT manualdoesnt even have a provision for full audit on mismatch, which is a basic & grave omission from ECI. Proper VVPAT audit with adequate sample size followed by full audit on any mismatch is essential part of voting right of every Indian. Proper VVPAT audit with adequate sample size followed by full audit on any mismatch is essential part of voting right of every Indian. Without proper audit election results carry no credibility & are essentially invalid. Even if there was no evidence of EVM error/rigging till now , it is no excuse to evade proper audit in future elections which is a different event. (X and Y can be entirely different) In Telengana at least in 31 constituencies votes counted were significantly more than votes polled . This essentially means evms are prone to error/rigging. Either (error or rigging) proves conclusively ECI EVM results cant be depended on & We must ensure every vote counts. And even in this 31 constituencies in Telengana ECI didn’t do the minimum step of immediate full VVPAT audit, let alone stop the results. Clause 56(D)(2) of election rules which leaves decision to count (VVPATs on candidate’s request) to sole discretion of returning officer is gravely misused . It has made the right of candidate to ask for VVPAT tally essentially nonexistent. Paper Ballots are much preferred in front of a technology(EVM VVPAT) that can and has been made unaccountable. It is frightening to see how easily we can be blinded by favourable election results & media opinions . We must be hopeful , but should not fail to do our duty as citizens in ensuring the integrity of elections.

上篇,北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇,"Wes Hsu Follow Wes Conference Review -- Share SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 對於SLUSH這個活動已經聽過多年，最早是在台灣的科技雜誌上翻過幾篇報導，不過當時沒有想過在數年後能進入會場親身體驗那幾頁光彩奪目的敘述。在2018年經歷赫爾辛基場的這段旅程後想要分享給更多的朋友，希望對創業、科技或是志工有興趣的朋友能有機會來參與這場盛會。 以下先給大家一個訊息公布的時間表，希望讓第一次申請工作人員的朋友，能降低每天更新信箱郵件匣的憂慮。 8/1 線上申請系統開放 8/6 註冊帳戶提交申請 10/7 線上報名系統截止 10/15 收到第一封組長的來信，詢問可行的Skype面試時間。 10/16 線上面試，並加入小組的WhatsApp群組。收到官方邀請信。 11/9 官方公布合作青年旅館、臉書大會資訊社團與住宿互助社團 11/14 第一封工作人員內部通訊信(Newsletter) 11/17 工作人員培訓日(可選擇參加)，於芬蘭埃斯波(Espoo)。 11/20 公布官方周邊活動(Side Events)。小組的第一次線上會議。 11/24 第二封工作人員內部通訊信，包含工作手冊。 11/27 第三封工作人員內部通訊信，會前訓練注意事項。 12/1 第四封工作人員內部通訊信，大會手機版APP釋出。 12/3 會前訓練與工作人員肖像照拍攝。 12/4 正式會期第一日。 12/5 正式會期第二日。 12/6 芬蘭獨立日。 12/7 國際志工周的新創團隊參訪。 12/8 志工限定會後派對 線上申請系統的資料填寫並不複雜，我相信對大多數的大學生半個小時即可完成，第一頁的基本資料包含，工作經驗與技能、先前志工經驗、語言技能與程度(並不需要附上檢定證明)、教育程度(選填)、專業領域(選填)、有興趣的大會主題(至多選擇三項)，接著，下個頁面是工作人員的申請，可以在三十多個小組選擇自己有興趣申請的團隊加入，我認為申請者需要事先對各組的工作內容有初步了解再勾選，因為這決定會期的工作排班與參展時間，如果排班與想聽的講座時間衝突，會降低預期的與會收穫，因此在下面我舉一些小組的工作性質，提供大家選填志願的參考。此外的問題還有是否願意擔任小組組長、是否能參加十一月的會前訓練、是否需要會期間的住宿等，最後最重要的是自我介紹與參展動機，沒有字數限制，我只用不到一百字表達自己的熱情以及對於會議的高度興趣，就通過了第一階段的書面審查。 超過三十種的工作性質小組，內部其實會在按造數字分成一組約十人，將兩千四百多位志工分配進每個小單位。以下是我在會場有接觸到的志工，因此以他們的工作經驗分享作介紹。 名牌印製小組(Badge Claim Team): 對於講者(Speaker)、與會者(Attendee)、投資者(Investor)與新創團隊(Startup)，進入主會場或是周邊活動前，都需要提供身分證或是護照以領取名牌與活動手環，才能參與後續的活動，工作地點除了會場外，可能會到市區購物中心或是餐館酒吧等周邊場地，工作環境因為需要印表機及筆電，能在溫暖的室內輪班。 講者接待小組(Slush Buddies Team): 需要與講者頻繁信件往來，安排接機或是市區交通的協助，是個很好的機會能與台上的產業先驅近距離接觸，如果講者在會後提前離開，志工在會期的工作量與時間並不長。 餐飲服務小組(Catering Team): 會場四處都設有杯水服務站，甚至可以選擇氣泡水，而遞水的工作就是由他們負責。對於想聽演講與參展的朋友並不理想，因為值班時間大多在會期進行時間。 衣帽間服務小組(Cloakroom Team): 會場的南北出口各設有衣帽架的大型場地，負責對於大衣以及背包標號存放與送回的工作，標籤是使用回收的纖維再製，是主辦方所講求的永續選擇。 派對支援小組(Parties Team): 在派對的飲品攤位負責取酒與開瓶的工作，活動結束後也一同回收瓶罐。其他組別也有負責檢查活動手環及發放酒券等工作。 周邊商品小組(Store Team): 會場一隅有官方的服飾如連帽長袖或是提袋與毛帽等商品，在紫外燈的照射下散發螢光，負責介紹產品特色與挑選尺寸。 永續回收小組(Sustainability Team): 現場設置大量的分類回收桶，永續志工的工作是引導與會者投入正確的桶子，一個我認為相當辛苦的職位。 志工區域小組(Volunteer Area Team): 在志工休息區有零食、水果、咖啡與氣泡飲料等簡單的食物可以領取，補貨與清潔桌面的工作是他們所執行。 第二階段的線上面試也不需要給自己太大的壓力，我自身的經驗是約十分鐘的談話，而話題涵蓋基本的自我介紹以及對於工作的想像與期待只占了一半，剩下的一半其實是組長簡介接下來一個多月的工作行程安排，還有確認組員能夠配合的時間。若是與自身預期有落差，都可以向組長提出，組員的調動是非常正常而且頻繁的。我雖然在十月就進入通訊群組，但直到十一月中我們這組的名單才更改成活動當天所呈現的人員。也因此，在收到罐頭拒絕信的當下並不要太氣餒，我有其他台灣志工朋友的經驗是11/9當天收到官方拒絕信後，約一周後的11/15又接到錄取通知信，我想是部分小組有組員退出，因此候補上先前刷掉的人選。 小結申請成功的要素，除了己身的服務熱忱外，我認為申請的時間也是一個考量的因素，高達兩千四百人的志工團隊，篩選的流程難以等到報名截止後才開始，提前送出申請使得更多的時間讓小組組長選入自己的組別。而我這次在系統開放第一周即提交申請，比起截止日提早了兩個月，希望有興趣的大家在明年也能在時間上取得一點申請優勢。 很幸運的我被選入派對支援小組，更讓其他志工羨慕的是我們這組的排班時間是在會期前一天與會期第一天的晚上時段，下午五點到凌晨三點的時間。因此在主場館的講座時間能夠讓我們自由運用，會期第二天的會後派對也不需要值班，可以跟與會者一樣享受到會場的獨特氣氛。此外工作地點與內容與其他派對支援組別並不太一樣，我們的工作場所都在市區的酒吧餐館，也不需要開瓶開罐遞飲料，而主要是查對訪客的邀請名單。組內總共有九個成員，一半都是芬蘭當地的學生，其餘來自國家有瑞典、印度、印尼與奈及利亞，不過大多目前都在北歐念書或是待業。 第一天的工作地點是在市區的創辦人大街(Founders Street, Kalevankatu)，街道兩旁餐館與酒吧林立，為了讓活動地點更加醒目，路中央有設置一個透明的管狀小空間，裡面有幾個小吧檯，幾盞強烈的暖氣燈，最重要的是DJ台，不過音響其實是置於室外，也就是在大街上撥放著派對樂曲，讓與會者路過街道小巷時不會錯過，同時我們也看到很多長者在經過音響時面帶嫌惡摀著耳朵快步通過。派對活動開始前，我們在名叫老學生浩室(Old student House)的展演舞台負責場佈如掛布條及綁彩帶等簡單工作，專業的燈光調控與環境音響系統則是其他廠商所包辦。活動期間，我們負責查對邀請名單，並發予特製單向手環，讓受邀訪客可以自由進出二樓貴賓休息室。同時在場地輪班的志工還有名牌印製小組，相比之下，他們的工作量比我們大的多。第一天排班時間較短，在午夜十二點前下崗，這時身上的志工名牌基本上是各個派對的通行證，但事實上我們都是滑開手機找尋最近一班開往青旅的巴士，然後刷著主辦單位發的交通卡快速返家，為了第一天會期上午十點的開幕表演。 第二天的工作地點則換到了市區外圍Kallio區的知名複合式酒吧，內部有三個主要的舞池還有一個樂團表演的舞台，而因為是邀請限定的派對，我們的工作比昨天繁重的多，需要一一查對訪客的名牌或是身分證，從兩千多個受邀賓客表單中尋找對應名字，而因為場地限制，我們的檢查點設在室外的棚架座位區，也就是在芬蘭十二月天與凜冽寒風併肩工作。 從十點開始訪客陸續湧入，最理想的查對情境是出示的名牌完全符合表單上的名字與身份，如講者、與會者或是投資者，次之的是出示身分證或是其他姓名的證明，最複雜的情況是輸入各種名字反覆搜尋之後，仍然無法顯示搜尋結果。若是第一個條件成立，我們接著引導賓客前往衣帽間並領取活動限定的單向手環，附加一個大大的微笑歡迎他們的到來；若是最後一種情況發生，往往需要解釋這個派對的性質，而我們也常得到不下十種的原因回覆，像是”我朋友轉寄了活動邀請”、”我公司的執行長已經進去派對場地等我們了”，或是”我代替有事無法前往的朋友來參加等等”。不過這些都不及無法勸阻，繼續在入口棚子下徘徊的群眾，此時與我們一起排班的近十位警衛工作量即呈現指數上升，需要清楚指明出口的方向來減緩壅塞的人流壓力。一直到凌晨兩點排隊人潮大幅減少，先前進場的賓客也漸漸離場，我們才結束這晚的值班任務。 過程中也遇到許多不耐煩的客人越過排隊隊伍，在柵欄前大聲嚷嚷，稱自己是受邀貴賓，要求快速通關的閘門，但後果可想而知，一樣被警衛請到隊伍最後面重新排隊。我也甚至遇過不在名單上的投資客，想要使用眼神脅迫施壓，甚至指著我的志工名牌，面帶不悅得說我記住你了之類的威脅語句，並在場外來回踱步了兩三圈才離去。雖然當下會猶豫自己到底要得罪幾十位北歐創業圈的投資客，但在一兩周後回想這些小顛簸，我認為只敢對付底層第一線工作人員的人格特質，也不適合成為未來的合作夥伴或是股東對象，對於當晚的試圖衝撞進入派對的人士也就少了一點愧疚感。與志工合作的警衛們，都是受過專業訓練、身著制服，可靠可信賴的彪形夥伴，必要時也建議我們遇到不符合名單的客人時只要舉手就好，他們會幫我們處理後續的解釋等工作，是我們特別感謝的搭檔，也是整場活動重要的工作之一。 以上是志工申請的步驟介紹與一些心得，我會在下一篇繼續介紹會場的演講與體驗，還有在赫爾辛基的參訪與行程安排，希望大家能在北歐的寒冬中度過暖暖充實的一周。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇。 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇

https://home.ohumanity.org/technological-determinism-in-superintelligence-4b0e1b9cf9dc?source=tag_archive---------88-----------------------,Technological Determinism in Superintelligence,Surviving Superintelligence: Part 3 of 4,"Surviving Superintelligence: Part 3 of 4 LeeAnn Felder-Heim Follow O’Humanity -- Listen Share Remember,Bostrom has taught usthat, in creating SI, we can “fail” [cause irreversible existential catastrophe] inmanyways; we face uncertainty at every turn; and we are leaving hugely important decisions about humanity’s future up to a robot, or up to humans who may not share our values. Bostrom asserts that these are inevitable facts; in this piece, I’m going to counter his determinism first with theory and then with real-world examples. Here it goes. Bostrom argues that it would be impossible to halt SI development because its incredible power will make it irresistible. Bostrom takes a deterministic standpoint in terms of technological development, in a similar way toJacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist. InThe Technological Society, Ellul describes the deterministic adoption of new technologies by saying that individuals and states — in order to avoid being crushed or outcompeted by technological advance — must align themselves with it: “The individual is in a dilemma; either he decides to safeguard his freedom of choice, chooses to use traditional, personal, moral or empirical means, thereby entering into competition with a power against which there is no efficacious defense and before which he must suffer defeat; or he decides to accept technical necessity, in which case he will himself be the victor, but only by submitting irreparably to technical slavery. In effect he has no freedom of choice.” “The individual is in a dilemma; either he decides to safeguard his freedom of choice, chooses to use traditional, personal, moral or empirical means, thereby entering into competition with a power against which there is no efficacious defense and before which he must suffer defeat; or he decides to accept technical necessity, in which case he will himself be the victor, but only by submitting irreparably to technical slavery. In effect he has no freedom of choice.” This mechanism removes freedom of choice from individuals as well as from politicians and entire states. In this way, all individuals and institutions are roped into furthering technological advance and efficiency. For example, while self-driving cars will put millions out of work, the fact that some country would inevitably develop them (and if another country does it before the US, we will lose even more jobs and market share) propelledPresident Obama to propose spending $4 billion on research into self-driving cars. On an individual level, I spent years arguing the merits of the flip-phone and railing against the smartphone, and then I (like a classic technical slave) jumped on the smartphone train in order to compete for a promotion at work. We can see the mechanism Ellul describes all around us. But does that mean that it is inescapable? For Ellul, it is — he is a libertarian purist and believes that any type of collective action is a part of “technical slavery” and is unacceptable because it reduces his “freedom.” But in the face of a technology (SI) that wouldliterallyremove all decision-making power from all ofhumanity(and potentially end in existential catastrophe), we must set purism aside. We must accept the reduction of certain types of freedoms to avoid the ultimate reduction in human freedom! Now that we’ve decided it is okay to use collective organizing to control deployment of dangerous technologies, we can point to a few positive examples of this in human history: biological and nuclear weapons. The use of biological weapons was first regulated by the Geneva Protocol, which was later supplemented by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) — to which 178 states have signed on (as of December 2016). The US enacted the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989, which applies the convention to private citizens and criminalizes violations of the convention. Onemajorflaw with the BWC is that it lacks any formal method for monitoring compliance; it instead asks for voluntary annual reports. Negotiations towards an internationally binding monitoring system took place between 1995 and 2001, ending when the Bush administration decided that the US could not be bothered by such silly things as international agreements to prevent mass human suffering… Nuclear weapon development, on the other hand, does have a robust monitoring system (put in place under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-ban Treaty). An international organization headquartered in Vienna uses various technologies (forensic seismology, hydroacoustics, infrasound and radionuclide monitoring) to monitor for any sign of a nuclear explosion. They deploy on-site inspection for countries where concerns about compliance arise. This organization has 337 monitoring facilities located all over the globe, and all monitoring data is sent to all states that have signed on to the treaty. In addition to this monitoring system, Mutually Assured Destruction AKA “Balance of Terror” (both great band names), continue to prevent nuclear attacks because, when country A launches a nuclear attack against country B, country B is able to launch a counterattack against country A before country A’s nuclear bomb launchers are annihilated. Both countries have early warning satellites and radar systems, allowing them to detect an attack within minutes and launch strategically located ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) against the aggressor country. Knowing this, both countries are very unlikely to launch an attack. So, we were close to having a binding monitoring system for biological weapons, and we have a robust monitoring system for nuclear weapons. Additionally, Mutually Assured Destruction further impedes the deployment of nuclear technologies. While we certainly have not removed all threat of nuclear or biological weapons, we also haven’t blown ourselves up yet. So, using these positive examples, we can theoretically apply similar methods for impeding SI deployment. In part 4, I will discuss two (big) remaining questions:Whatwould be required to impede the deployment of SI? And,Howcan we make sure that happens?",LeeAnn Felder-Heim,https://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page---byline--4b0e1b9cf9dc---------------------------------------,6,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg,2019-01-02T04:07:50.671Z,Medium

The company was named in their memory.","Two months after they started developing the product, two ten-year-old girls — Coral Sheri and Or Koren — drowned in a private swimming pool in Savyon. The company was named in their memory. The Jerusalem Post Follow Jerusalem Post -- Listen Share BYEYTAN HALON As winter gradually gives way to spring in the coming months, Israeli families with private swimming pools will slowly start dreaming of enjoying a refreshing splash once again. While for the vast majority, pools provide a way to cool off from the summer sun,2018 was overshadowed by the tragic increase of children and adults who drowned at home. After unsuccessfully searching for a drowning detection solution for his own private pool, entrepreneur and homeland security expert Eyal Golan partnered with computer vision specialist Dr. Tamar Avraham in 2014 to establish Haifa-based Coral Drowning Detection Systems and prevent the tragedies that strike dozens of Israeli families and many more worldwide every year. Their first-of-its-kind, patent-pending Coral Manta system constantly “watches” and detects movement in private pools using a built-in underwater video camera, computer vision and artificial intelligence technology. When it identifies a potential drowning situation, it sounds an ear-piercing alarm and immediately sends a smartphone alert to all household members. “When we started developing Coral Manta, we had three major principles in mind,” Golan toldThe Jerusalem Post. “It has to be affordable, it has to be very reliable and precise in detecting real events, and it has to be a plug-and-play system. All you have to do is mount two screws on the corner of the pool and the system is stable and safe.” Two months after they started developing the product, two 10-year-old girls — Coral Sheri and Or Koren — drowned in a private swimming pool in Savyon. The company was named in their memory. The company harnesses the latest deep learning technology to ensure maximum detection rates and very few false alarms, in a similar manner to advanced surveillance technology and self-driving vehicles. In this case, however, movement must be detected underwater. “In surveillance cameras, the technology assumes that the surroundings don’t move,” Avraham said “But the water moves all the time. We had to develop ways to notify the user if the water becomes cloudy, and add other sensors to operate in the dark.” The system primarily relies on solar power, operates 24/7 and has undergone rigorous testing to ensure it is fully waterproof, resistant to swimming pool chemicals and can withstand both soaring summer temperatures and freezing winter weather. The detection technology was tested, the company says, in thousands of scenarios simulating both child and adult drowning events, in a wide range of swimming pools. Contrary to popular belief, drowning is usually silent and undramatic. “Of course, no system — especially when working with a single sensor — can offer 100% protection,” Golan said. “Even at airports and borders, you typically have layers of security as all systems have their flaws. It’s the same thing with pool safety. Coral Manta is not meant to replace adult supervision, but to fill the gap when you are distracted and compensate for our human flaws.” While medical professionals believe irreversible brain damage starts to occur after approximately five minutes without oxygen, the Coral Manta alarm system starts working within seconds to enable quick assistance and resuscitation if needed. Other pool alarms currently on the market aim to prevent unauthorized access rather than operating when people are actually using the pool. Most drownings occur, however, when access to the pool is allowed. “Coral Manta is the most important safety layer ever created for the private pool environment,” said Golan. “There are simply no drowning detection systems for private pools. Those for public pools assist lifeguards, and there are so many false alarms. For residential pools, this is the only drowning detection system available.” The company is currently expanding their global reach through distributors in Australia, the US and other countries. Priced at $2,000, customers can also order the product online through the company’s website.

https://medium.com/@cambridgetricia/2019-resolutions-for-berlins-startup-scene-1aacf7ed4c45?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,2019 Resolutions For Berlin’s Startup Scene,German GmbH Challenges:,"Tricia Levasseur Follow -- 1 Listen Share Looking forward to 2019, here are some potential new years resolutions Berlin’s startup scene could consider for increasing the ecosystem’s success over the next year as the UK prepares to Brexit and leaves Berlin as the EU’s largest startup hub. This isn’t a new piece of constructive criticism.Berlin appears to be fond of copying. It can be pretty shameless. Some startups make no attempt to evolve beyond something that already exists. Sure, in business it’s good to benchmark your competition. But what seems to go on in a few places around Berlin isn’t benchmarking, it is straight copying. I find this sad for a few reasons. Startup employees with genuine creativity who care about providing value to customers and shareholders feel like their internal flame is being slowly extinguished at a clone factory. It’s also not a good way to mentor young people just entering employment by teaching them that they shouldn’t think for themselves but instead switch-off their robust brains and just copy. What will these workers be like in 10-20 years time when they’ll most likely be needed to use their creative problem solving brains? And demonstrate true leadership skills? This just feels damaging for long-term career development. What happens when Germany’s workforce has a fat layer of mid and senior level managers who are only skilled at copying? On the other hand, buyers — including German consumers — deserve better than cheap knock-offs being pushed to try and position a startup for a quick high priced acquisition for founder paydays and investor profits. Copying will only make you as good as the one you’re copying *IF* you’re lucky. It will never make you better. And in today’s highly competitive marketplace creating a unique brand buyers fall in love with is necessary for long term success. I also wonder how Berlin will manage to outmanouver the largest startup hub in Europe, London, if it’s main startup driver happens to be cloned companies?London’s having a bit of a moment with Brexit, but people don’t actively sit around thinking about existing businesses they can copy and roll-out for fast money. But this absolutely happens in Berlin. All. The. Time. Further, here’s a U.S.example. Think about Facebook. It was not the first social network. MySpace and LinkedIn were already operational. However, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t sit around in his dorm at Harvard wondering how to clone MySpace. Instead he was inspired by the other nextworks and created something new with clear differentiating factors that people could really fall in love with. Since Facebook was different enough to become original — people did fall in love with it — and Facebook was able to scale globally. Copying what everyone else is doing also isn’t a long-term strategy for growing a sustainable economy.If all you want to do is create clones and sell into foreign companies as fast as possible — that’s not really setting the German economy up to have decades of rich global businesses driving it. Germany is still lucky to have a strong automotive industry but, with the way startups in Berlin are now, I’d worry about relying on the city’s copy-cat segement of startups to be the next generation of long-term German giants. Consumers fall in love with things that are original AND original can be scaled globally. Either be completely original or be inspired. Don’t just copy. This is an outdated and, in my opinion, unhelpful strategy that has roots in the City’s own marketing. Perhaps competing on price worked 15 years ago to get people back into Berlin. These days not only is it not exactly true, it sets the bar very low for the expectations of companies and founders coming to Berlin. Many who are enticed to come to Berlin by this marketing campaign, expect to pay the lowest price for everything including the people they hire. So, employees are faced with a rude reality when they’re offered salaries that are below the market rate. Further, if you stroll into any online expat forum, you’ll see there are always workers talking about how some jobs didn’t even pay at all. For the unlucky, they were greeted by the unofficial ‘Berlin Startup Welcome Package’ where they got hired, and then gave a big old brain-dump of intel into their new employer during the onboarding process only to be let-go just before actually reporting for their first shift. Sometimes the startup worker is cut even after having paid for their own relocation. Out of the startup employees who have paid for their own move and experience fast job loss, there’s a segement further that still never receives any conpensation for the work completed and costs incurred. Other times people struggle to get their last paycheck paid. Indeed, the word I see used most online to describe Berlin’s startup employment offering is ‘precarious’. While these shenanigans may be happening in other startup ecosystems, they simply aren’t talked about or documented at the rate that I see this happening in Berlin. Cruise into the expat forums and read for yourself. People with first-hand knowledge of the Berlin scene, regularly try to be a pal and drive newcomers to other cities in Germany where employment is more dependable. This reputation for Berlin as having ‘precarious employment’ is not good and can only be cleaned-up by following proper human resources policies and laws. For startups to be encouraged to stop exploiting talent, the City itself needs to care and actually enforce rules and regulations on the employers who are violating the norms. For that to happen, Berlin needs to stop marketing itself as the cheapest option going because people tend to not respect things when they’re operating on a race to the bottom. AndBerlin isn’t cheap anymore— something that’ssparked several protests recently. For those that haven’t heard, housing is in short supply across Germany’s major cities meanwhile prices are at an all-time high. Many expats complain about the ruthlessness of house hunting. Their stories contain the same shenanigans from Berlin to Munich. “Expat forums are filled with tips, and an English-speaker advised newcomers to submit CVs, pay slips, credit histories and references to potential landlords. Apartment hunters often wind up starting jobs while they urgently hunt for a home in the evenings. They sleep on friends’ couches, mull bribes and swap stories of scams.”—Allision Williams, Handlesblatt Global “Expat forums are filled with tips, and an English-speaker advised newcomers to submit CVs, pay slips, credit histories and references to potential landlords. Apartment hunters often wind up starting jobs while they urgently hunt for a home in the evenings. They sleep on friends’ couches, mull bribes and swap stories of scams.” —Allision Williams, Handlesblatt Global It’s common knowledge that having people living in your city is a good thing. Workers spend their wages locally on things like rent, food, transportation, and entertainment. But it isn’t good enough to just take money from people without providing a lawful environment for them to live and work anymore. All business schools teach the dangers of competing on cost. Berlin is not an undesirable city trying to regenerate. It is a nation’s capital and the second largest city in Europe. And the business policy makers need to start behaving like that. After updating the city’s strategy to not attract business by competing as the cheapest option going, leaders need to improve business regulations to make things more accessible and inclusive. Now let’s take a step back to understand where things are today. Berlin entered the 20th century as a global powerhouse for technology and banking. For example,Siemens built and operated the first telegraph from Europe to the United Statesfrom Berlin. At the same time that Berlin was creating world changing technological innovations, the city was also home to many international banks. But then the World Wars happened and brought very dark times. Afterwards Berlin was left destroyed, de-industrialized, and divided. As a result, all the big companies and banks moved away, and new companies avoided the very complicated situation Berlin had. Even when reunification happened in 1990, Berlin had some major challenges. Officials needed to reunite a collapsed socialistic planned economy with low productivity and few competitive products on the Eastern side with a highly subsidized economy on the Western side. As a result of reunification, there was a lot of pressure to find new ways to develop and move Berlin’s unified economy forward. During the decades since reunification, Berlin’s changed. It has become one of the leading digital hotspots for Europe. It also holds a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. Berlin’s startup scene is the largest within the Eurozone and the second largest in the European Union only behind London. Government officials state that every 20 hours a startup is founded within its technology sector. And if the UK completes the Brexit process, Berlin will become the largest startup ecosystem within the European Union too. But all this incredible growth isn’t coming without highlighting additional challenges. With the attraction and creation of new businesses, the city’s population has grown rapidly over the last 10 years. Housing in Berlin is under pressure as already mentioned — there were no shortage of news headlines about this throughout 2018. This means politicians need to consider how to foster economic growth while continuing to provide a high quality of living. In my opinion, it also means they need to consider looking at their business registration processes and employment regulation. In Germany the main company form that startups choose is also the most widespread type of company formation in Germany, theGesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or “GmbH”, which translated literally, means a ‘company with limited liability’. For comparision, in the UK the main company form startups tend to choose is the LTD or limited liability company. As far as European businesses go, both the Germany GmbH and the UK LTD (registered in England and Wales) offer strong international confidence due to the high operational standards applied by the German and British regulators and the established legal framework in both Germany and England. However, while in Germany having limited liability is ideal for entrepreneurs who want to protect their private assets while projecting a public image of legitimacy to their customers and business partners, the GmbH often presents challenges for founders that ultimately make it less attractive than some other country’s limited liability formations. German GmbH Challenges: High fees for entry in the commercial register (Handelsregister) High investment costs: a minimum capital of €25,000 must be available, and at least half of this must be available in the business account at the time of entry into the Handelsregister High secondary costs: Consultancy fees for lawyers and tax advisers can cost up to €2,000 Restrictions on one-person-GmbHs to create capital in the form of contributions in kind, which place a high financial burden on the individual In cases of bankruptcy (Insolvenz): Missing capital contributions must be offset by private assets; this becomes especially burdensome for one-person-GmbHs While some might be thinking “this is great, I know any German company I’m doing business with has a solid foundation!” there are other areas that are holding German GmbHs back. At the recently heldTechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, I attended a panel discussion that addressed fundraising for German startups. One of the biggest hurdles identified was the fact it is so unattractive to issue employee shares from a GmbH. It was felt by panellists that this needed to be addressed by authorities as a matter of urgency to make German businesses even more competitive. According to the hosts of the session I attended, the law firmFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP;“employee share plans [in Germany] incentivize, motivate and retain management board members and executive employees, and consequently increase the company’s productivity, but are also seen as a capital investment tool in the current low-interest phase. Compared to other European countries, the total number of participants in employee share plan participants in Germany is relatively small. One key reason is that employee share plans do not provide significant tax benefits under German tax laws (for example, in comparison to Austrian or UK laws).” When a startup issues shares in a German GmbH, employee plans can offer both shares and other forms of long-term incentives to provide a mixture of cash and equity-related instruments. Typically, shares are most likely to be offered once a startup has received venture capital funding and the VC helps oversee the development of an employee share plan. However, the major downside for executive level-employees in accepting a job where much of the salary is in share options is that there is no specific tax relief for employees regarding share option plans in Germany. This really needs to be revisited by lawmakers because it is a huge hurdle for startups to offer and get employees onto a share plan and there’s a lot of research that shows its good for everyone when employees own a stake in their employer’s company. It also helps startups distribute costs during those critical early years when the finance team prefers to invest cash back into the business to help make it grow. And finally, it is legal for GbmH’s to offer shares conditionally — meaning they are only exercisable if an employee hits performance targets or time-based vested conditions are met. The debate at Techcrunch Disrupt Berlin had two main complaints: For startups that have not proven they can survive yet while offering largely equity-based salaries, employees said they viewed this as too much risk to accept. Employees weren’t interested in an equity based package because it wasn’t clear if the delayed gratification would pay off. At the same time, if they did manage to make money from shares, the tax rate for GmbH employees was so high that any share amount would have to be large for any serious amount of money to be made for all the hard work completed while deferring total compensation for many years. Startup owners complained employees in Berlin just want cash without equity. Some said they try to offer plans, but employees refuse them because the regulations surrounding them are so unattractive (especially in comparison to the US, UK, and Canada). Let’s take a closer look at GmbH Share Options Plan particulars: For clarity, the law firmFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLPexplains;“the benefit derived from the exercise of share options is generally subject to income taxes and taxed as employment income. The taxable benefit is also subject to a solidarity surcharge and to church tax (if applicable). The taxable benefit is the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise (that is, the date when the shares are recorded in the employee’s account). The benefit is added to the employee’s taxable income and subject to the employee’s individual progressive income tax rate. The highest marginal income tax rate in 2017 is 45%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge levied on the income tax. The church tax rate (if applicable) depends on the religious community and the federal state to which the employee belongs. The taxable benefit is also subject to social security contributions (different rates apply to pension, unemployment and healthcare insurance). Social security contributions are, however, capped, so that no additional contributions are levied if the total employment income exceeds a certain level per year. The employer and the employee are each liable for half of the contributions.” Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLPfurther details regulations for employees selling their shares;“on the disposal of shares acquired on exercise of an option, the capital gain is subject to (privileged) capital gains tax at a flat rate of 25% (plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax, if any) provided that the shares were placed in the employee’s account after 31 December 2008. If the shares comprise 1% or more of the company’s total share capital, the employee’s individual income tax rate applies. In this case, 40% of the capital gains are tax-exempt. The taxable capital gain is the difference between the acquisition cost (that is, the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise) and the sale price. If the capital gain from the disposal of shares is paid out or credited by a German financial services institution (or an equivalent institution), withholding taxes must generally be deducted by that institution and paid to the tax authorities. Generally, the tax deduction is final (Abgeltungsteuer). However, on application by the employee, the individual income tax rate can be applied if it is more beneficial to the employee. If no German financial services institution is involved, the employee must declare the capital gain in his or her personal annual income tax return.” There’s no question that Berlin is a dynamic and vibrant city. The quality of life is good compared to many other cities of its size. But if Berlin’s startup ecosystem wants to really soar in 2019, adjusting its attitude towards copying other businesses, not competing as the cheapest option going, and making its regulatory approach to issuing employee shares more competitive will help the city’s startups achieve even greater success.

Just like in2017, I have probably grown and achieved more myself and with the different set of amazing people I came in contact with. In the year 2018, I learnt a lot more in business and tech understanding how both go hand in hand, worked with an amazing team in building a world-class product, learnt teamwork and collaboration, attended both local and International conferences, had the privilege to participate in different competitions, Hackathons and Product Exhibitions. I’ll love to share a review of how my year went and the things I was involved in, to realize how far I have come and how much I need to contribute to making a difference. Establishing a strategic, bilateral Technology and economic relationship between Silicon Valley and Nigeria. Early this year, I had the privilege to get in to participate in an Intensive 2nd immersion program training into Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Business Intelligence, IoT, Block-chain, Start-Ups, Cloud Computing and much more. The training was hosted bySV-NED Incand participating companies from Silicon Valley including Oracle Africa, IBM Nigeria, HP Africa and General Electric. Also, I was trained by a Stanford University Emeritus Professor( Dr. Sam Haddad), an Angel Investor from Mexico( Silicon Valley Miguel Casillas), An Advanced Cyber-security solution strategist from Cisco( Sam Washington), a Professor from New-York State University, top engineers and experts from IBM, Oracle, General Electric and HP. The training and lectures lasted for days and I had the opportunity to visit IBM, Oracle, HP office and made use of their facilities. After the rigorous training and exposures, I had my final Online technical examination at the GTI Nigerian stock exchange trading floor. The exam was marked and graded by Silicon Valley experts and after a couple of days the final result came out. To the glory of God, I came out first position with a perfect score of 100%. I was very happy I made such achievement and I give God all the glory. I got an Award from HP Africa and From SV-NED Inc. Thanks to everyone that celebrated with me. After, I became part of the founding team of folks who started SV-NED Inc Lagos Incubator, Lekki and I served as Technical Director facilitating training and lectures for young talents, Entrepreneurs and start-up owners in current technologies. It was such an amazing opportunity and experience. After, I had the opportunity to participate various programs like SV-NED and HP Africa Got’s talent in Info-Tech challenge, IBM Africa Innovation challenge were I did very well in both and I came out top. I was later awarded with a merit award certificate and golden medal by the CEO/Co-Founder of SV-NED Inc. Chief Temitope Ajayi. I sincerely want to thank her and appreciate her for given me such privilege, for her motherly love and care. Thanks to Our SV-NED president, Ms Dennis Williams and my Project Director, Maxwell. I later appeared on the Nigeria Independence Newspaper featuring SV-NED Inc. SV-NED Holds Graduation Ceremony For Immersion Participants | Independent Newspapers Nigeria Silicon Valley Nigeria Economic Development (SV-NED) has held a graduation ceremony for people who participated at the… www.independent.ng I give God all the Glory and i thank everyone involved for such opportunity and privilege. Our mission is to empower people with the ability to do more with technology. I joined an amazingly fast-growing startup company at the Obafemi Awolowo University, calledInvenTech. We are a team of hardware, software and business engineers were we are building a web-based drag and drop platform that gives you a new way to program, control and monitor microcontrollers using IoT at its core and also we have a hardware product calledInventOneboard( a microcontroller that’s made in Nigeria by Nigerians). I bet you it’s better than other Micro-controllers out there. We had a lot of achievements this year as a company. We got the opportunity to exhibit and showcase our products atTechpoint Inspired,the largest tech conference in West Africa in May, with close to over 1000 tech experts and enthusiasts coming to check out our platform. It was really overwhelming seeing how people came around to our stand loving what we’ve built. Later we go interviewed and featured by Techpoint crew because they also loved our products. Weeks later, we got an invite by HP Africa courtesy SV-NED inc and we had the chance to pitch our platform to HP Africa Top executives. We also had a training seminar at the Electrical and Electronics Department, OAU were Professors, Lecturers, and students came to learn more about our invention and learnt how to use it. Months later we were invited to train students and lecturers of the Computer science department,Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Ibadanon IoT using our Lab and InventOne board. I got an Invite from Google to represent InvenTech at theGoogle Developers Agency program. The goal of the program is to help upskill and promote top Nigerian software development companies leveraging on Google’s Technologies. The program was a full day technical event with tech talks and product reviews. Thanks to Victor Shoaga and Ayomide Bakare and other amazing InvenTech folks for us all working together to attain a Vision. More accomplishment and greater height for us in 2019. Student Innovation Challenge 2018(SIC) Around June, I and one my Colleague(from Team RTS) got selected for a Federal Government Competition calledStudent Innovation Challenge 2018. We represented Obafemi Awolowo University alongside with other universities and polytechnics across Nigeria. It was a platform to pitch the innovative project that we are working on to a panel of judges selected from different subsectors and industries across the country. What we are working on is a Robotics Gaming platform using AI and Computer Vision. We won at the South-West Regionals held at the University of Lagos. The competition is still ongoing at other regions of the country. Thanks toiQube Labsfor giving such opportunity to learn and work on such an amazing project. I had the opportunity to meet with and take pictures with the Vice president of Nigeria, Prof.Yemi Osinbanjo and also had a Presidential Handshake. Later we got featured on the competition official website and on various social media platforms. Code with me Was an Intensive 3 weeks boot camp training I helped facilitated and organized for students new to programming at OAU. The areas of training include: Android development, Website developments and Hardware using C++. I was part of the tutor who trained students on Web Development- Front End. The students later built their personal portfolio website at the end of the training. Google I/O Extended, OAU I helped facilitated and organized the Google I/O Extended 2018 event with other students Organizers. The program is an annual developer conference held by GDG OAU that brings students, developers and Tech enthusiasts around Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife community for talks and Hands-on learning and technical code labs on flutter, machine learning, cloud and Android. The event is to recreate the experience at the last Google I/O 2018 held by Google in Mountain view. IEEE OAU This year I was appointed as the Technical Director and Assistant PRO for the Student Body. I helped facilitated and Organized 2018 IEEE Xtreme Global programming competition.

What’s going on?","Member-only story In society, politics, and technology, it increasingly feels like we’re being swindled. What’s going on? Colin Horgan Follow -- 10 Share Three days after Christmas, Twitter user Kilgore Trout (with over 51,000 followers)tweeteda link to a GoFundMe fundraising page, writing, “hello I am catching the crowdfunding wave but also being extremely honest please contribute today.” The reason for the GoFundMe page? “I Am Just Taking Your Money. There Is No Reason,” the fundraising page put it. GoFundMe eventually took the page down, but not before it raised $69 (“the perfect RIP,” Trout tweeted). The page was clearly a joke, but one that resonated in the waning days of 2018, a year in which it seemed like just about everything was being exposed as a scam. Kilgore Trout’s GoFundMe, for instance, appeared only days after another fundraising attempt on the sitewas revealedas a $400,000 scam. In autumn 2017, a young couple from New Jersey set up a page to raise money for a man they claimed was a destitute war veteran who they said gave the woman his last $20 so she could refill her gas tank. Before the story was exposed as a complete fabrication, the couple had been featured prominently by major media outlets that attached themselves to a heartwarming viral tale.",Colin Horgan,,3546,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg,2019-01-03T19:27:57.566Z,Medium
https://medium.com/free-code-camp/720-free-online-programming-computer-science-courses-you-can-start-in-january-96988eb0c52f?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,720 Free Online Programming & Computer Science Courses You Can Start in January,Published inWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news,"Dhawal Shah Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- Listen Share Seven years ago, universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today, more than 850 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses, popularly known as Massive Open Online Courses orMOOCs. I’ve compiled this list of 720 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveragedClass Central’s database of over 11,000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating. I’ve sorted these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level: Beginner Intermediate Advanced Courses that are being offered for the first time are marked as[NEW]. Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later in January. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2019 on Class Central’sComputer Science,Data Science, andProgrammingsubject pages. I understand this a long list and might be daunting for learners new to programming. In that case, you might findDavid Venturi’s recommendations for the bestData Science online coursesuseful — even if you’re not looking to learn Data Science. I hope to create more of these guides in the future. And finally if you have trouble figuring out how to signup for Coursera courses for free, don’t worry — I’vewritten an article on how to do that, too.

Then you have most likely experienced a robocall.Robocallsare simply (for the most part unwanted) phone calls with prerecorded messages. Such have increased in recent years because technology has enabled “robocallers” (for lack of better word) to easily make calls from anywhere in the world for cheap. Who uses robocalls? Telemarketers, politicians, non-profit organizations and… you’ve guessed it: scammers and other unsavory characters who often hide their identities, displaying a fake Caller ID. Telecommunication firm YouMailestimates robocallsat around 151 million per day in the United States alone, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and FCC have seen a significant increase in consumer complaints in the last few years. Ian Barlow, the FTC’s Do Not Call Program Coordinator,toldThe Vergethe agency is processing an average of roughly 500,000 complaints every month. Some individuals have had enough and seek revenge… calling back numbers from robocallers then proceeding to “troll” scammers.",Phil Siarri,,4,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*pUYKvPwasZHFy5cvgPqvwQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*pUYKvPwasZHFy5cvgPqvwQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*pUYKvPwasZHFy5cvgPqvwQ.jpeg,2019-01-03T16:29:27.205Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@SaloneSehgal/peering-through-the-lens-from-seed-to-growth-9be937353ebc?source=tag_archive---------109-----------------------,Peering Through The Lens: From Seed To Growth,Written bySalone Sehgal,"Salone Sehgal Follow -- Listen Share The end of the year is a great time for reflection. These are a combinations of learnings and observations garnered from being on both sides of the table across various life cycles of tech companies. Over 10+ years of looking outside-in as an investment banker, advisor, mentor, now early stage VC (focused on interactive entertainment/gaming) and as a complete insider incepting, building, operating and even winding down a company. The Goldilocks rule:The biggest competition for entertainment companies is boredom. Traditional “problem/solution” approach of investing where investors find companies who actively solve consumer “pain points” does not necessarily work for entertainment/gaming content investments. Especially at the early stage where funding and finding entertainment bets needs to be multi-dimensional and nuanced. Trends and consumption patterns change often and swiftly. Staying on top of the curve requires active avoidance of confirmation bias and involves gauging the current pulse of consumer experiences. Invest too early and the companies need a lot of time and capital to gestate/alter consumer behaviour. Invest too late and you have missed the hype and most likely exit cycle. Hence, the “Goldilocks” rule becomes paramount- the timing needs to be just right. Network trumps all value add:Entrepreneurs value investors for network and ability to open doors where they can’t get access and to occasionally brainstorm strategic ideas and vision. Once in a deal — network, fundraising connections and the right introductions are often the most valued asset an investor can offer to portfolio companies. Anything additional — product guidance, recruitment assistance, analytical insights while much appreciated in the moment; over the long term goes unacknowledged and gets forgotten. To reduce the funding gap investors need to help female founders build fundable teams:While a lot has been written about the struggles of female founders in accessing and raising capital, not a lot has been researched on recruitment challenges faced by female founders particularly at the seed stage. While this may be anecdotal, most of the female founders I advise have trouble recruiting and building early teams as compared to male peers. This inherently weakens their business case when they raise money or it results in them raising less money than desired. This is a perverse cycle where without a high caliber team, it is hard to raise venture capital and without capital, it is hard to attract a high caliber team. More so, in the case of female founders which results in them being undercapitalised or remaining unfunded, further perpetuating and widening the funding chasm. Venture investment can often act be the catalyst and enabler for sole female founders to attract talent. Commercial and financial skill sets are an asset in all early founding teams:Founding teams now need the right mix of product, technical and commercial expertise to succeed and propel themselves to the next level. Too often, creative and technical teams will postpone financial and strategic hires to after a Series A. However, sadly by then most of the commercially unsound decisions have already been taken. That can be exhibited in the form of poor investment terms at angel/seed round; bad cashflow management; lack of focus and commercial discipline, falling victim to predatory partnerships etc. A co-founder with financial and strategic acumen is a necessity and asset in all early founding teams. Founders need to build with realistic optimism:Getting the balance between realism and optimism is often hard for founders. Particularly first-time entrepreneurs. While all founders need to drink their own kool-aid, exude utmost confidence and conviction about their companies, very few maintain the ability to stay dispassionate enough to detach from the day to day and make the right decisions. Not pivoting in time, not killing products, not growing fast enough, not seeing the sunset on the horizon for the business and preparing to sell, not firing the wrong people, not introspecting and/or spotting the lacunae in business model or team etc. are all common challenges for founders. Founders can overcome this by investing in good executive coaching to help uncover decision making blind spots. Are you a conviction or an optionality bet?Often a VC portfolio will be a combination of high-conviction, large investments alongside low conviction, small, optionality bets. Both large and small cheque sizes are going to be relative depending on fund size. However, understanding which side of the equation an investment falls on is often critical for the founder to gauge the likelihood of receiving follow-on capital and positioning a future round. The optionality bets are usually the ones that investors are less likely to support when things get rough. When existing investors don’t “signal” interest in follow-on rounds, further capital raising becomes challenging. It’s a risk most founders underestimate. M&A readiness is very useful:M&A and fundraising preparedness is a skill set greatly under-appreciated by both founders and VC’s. Given that most exits happen via M&A as opposed to IPO, founders should build acquirer relationships early on. Within a VC fund, helping portfolio companies systematically think and prepare for M&A can often be helpful for both the healthy companies and the ones that won’t make it the whole way. For the laggards, M&A only emerges as an option in the form of a distress sale/acquihire which rarely leaves any value to be extracted for either the founder or investor. This can be actively avoided through foresight and planning. Beware the zombie startups:These are startups which neither fail nor succeed. After some initial promise, they hit a plateau and keep chugging along. They keep cash burn low. Occasionally, they will break even or eke out some profit. They don’t result in a meaningful uplift in metrics for a VC but do well enough to support a team. However, value creation opportunities often decrease as time elapses. These companies often need #5 or #7 to either change course or reach a logical outcome. The most important learning has been that nothing compares to the journey of an entreprenuer. As an investor the experience of having been a founder helps hone into insights, instincts and intellectual muscle that perhaps ordinarily may not have developed. And hopefully, the empathy for founders balances the pontification of an investor. So, here is to more learnings, growth and reflection in the next year!",Salone Sehgal,https://medium.com/@SaloneSehgal?source=post_page---byline--9be937353ebc---------------------------------------,10,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*WqNgJWWW_HorG0I4q-Js_g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*WqNgJWWW_HorG0I4q-Js_g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*WqNgJWWW_HorG0I4q-Js_g.jpeg,2019-01-03T05:59:08.098Z,Medium
https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/online-communities-part-2-prerequisites-scaling-and-some-great-examples-a43c9746a207?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,"Online Communities — Part 2: Prerequisites, scaling, and some great examples.",When the scale starts breaking,"Eylon Aviv Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share In theprevious article, we talked about what is a community. But just like Rome, or any other city for that matter, communities are not built in a day. It’s a process that usually requires a hard, concentrated, and extended effort from a single or a small group of people. The keys to a successful community Have you ever wondered why some communities succeed long-term and some don’t, why do they break and what makes people leave them? I’ve researched what are some characteristics and prerequisites for creating successful online communities. There are many categories and subcategories and a lot of literature.Stan Garfield,the legendary Community evangelist has done extensive research on this and according to him, these are 3 keys to communities of practice. Acompelling topic:The members and potential members must be passionate about the subject for collaboration, and it must be relevant to their work. Acritical massof members:You usually need at least 100 members, with 200 being a better target. See thisrelated discussion thread(twitter). Acommitted leader:The community leader should know the subject, have the energy for stimulating collaboration, have sufficient time to devote to leadership, and then regularly spend time increasing membership, lining up speakers, hosting calls and meetings, asking and answering questions, and posting information which is useful to the members. The first two points are clear — you need a common topic of interest that the members of the community share, and you need enough people to create that community. Let's focus on the third. Communities require a leader, there is no way for a community to form without one or a few leaders that invest time and effort into building it, creating content, and setting the path and values for the community and its future members. Also, social media seems to have allowed us to surpassDunbar’s numberof up to 200 stable relationships,or has it? When the scale starts breaking What happens if/when the community grows? Big communities can become a source of power — from organizing movements of change to purchasing power and buying syndicates, all the way tobuying a castle together. The Leader or the person who started the community now finds himself with more and more power. More often than not the leader realizes his power — “I built this community, this community is mine, and I decide what happens to it.” But wait, how can one person own the community, how can one person decide? What about joint ownership, isn’tthatcommunity? As communities grow, their purpose and objective grow with them. Pivots and shifts in the direction of the community can be quite drastic from where the community started from. What happens when there’s a disagreement between the community members and the leader regarding these shifts? Let's play a thought experiment. Tomorrow, your community present you with a signed petition of over 60% members. There, they request you to relinquish your admin-ship and pass the baton to someone else.Will you do as they request, or stick to your guns? What about other cases where the leader no longer serves the community or forces his agenda. Maybe he grew tired of the community and doesn’t want to manage it anymore. Or maybe he decides to monetize it. From running ads at the expense of the members,silencing people who think differently or oppose them, and all the way toselling the group. AsCyndi Laupertaught us back in the 80s,Dan Ariely at Burning man, or countless articles, songs, and experiments — we change when faced with money. Another thought experiment — Someone offers you a million dollars to sell your community, to use at their discretion. This is not ‘never work again in your life money’ but it is a lump sum. Some of you are community managers, right? What would you do?(If you decide to give it to your community of 10,000 members each will get $100) Communities are dependent on their leaders to run them justly and not to succumb to temptations of personal gain — power, money, or status. In the process of scaling online communities, the leaders are thesingle point of failure. How do you get past this hurdle? What are examples of communities and online communities that have really managed to grow, thrive, and scale? How did the leaders of the community who are essential to its formation acted? What did they do differently? To get a clue lets explore some of the successful communities that have survived the tests of time. Wikipedia On October 27th, 2001,Jimmy Walescreated Wikipedia, which will later become the first online distributed community.These are statements of principles, emphasizing openness, open source, andneutral point of viewwhich have guided the Wikipedia community over the years. Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. that’s our commitment. — Wikimedia foundation Satement Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. that’s our commitment. — Wikimedia foundation Satement One of those principals is: Newcomers are always to be welcomed.There must beno cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers …. so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.” Newcomers are always to be welcomed.There must beno cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers …. so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.” Anyone is welcome to join and after a short process, you are an equal member and contributor in the community. —Joint Ownership. Wikipedia is now in the top #5 most visited websites in the world, with Google, Youtube, Facebook, and Baidu preceding it —consequently, these are some of the richest companies in the world, led by the richest entrepreneurs. Jimmy has got to be one of the richest people in the world right?Well no, his net worth is estimated at a bit over $1 Million. As some of you may know Wikipedia is non-profit,it’s run by the community, for the community. Had it been for profit, had there been a personal incentive to buildJimmy Wales’ company? Do you think people would contribute to Wikipedia? To someone else’s wealth? I think Jimmy realized that the only way for Wikipedia to fulfill it’s potential and become the sum of all knowledge it has to be a true community, jointly owned by its users and free of any personal gain. Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal .— Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal . — Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales Bitcoin Bitcoin is a social phenomenon backed by mathematics. I don’t think anyone can argue about the strength of the Bitcoin community, after more than330 obituariesand counting, it still exists and continues to create headlines. The stronger the social connections in that community, the stronger Bitcoin will be. Why are people a part of the Bitcoin community? On the surface, it’s speculation and monetary gain. People buy bitcoin because they speculate that it will go up in value. But a lot of those, myself included, stayed for more than that. FromAustrian economicviews, theexcessive power of banks, and economic equality. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are exactly the same of a Community — Joint ownership enforced by the protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a system that assumes selfish behavior and ensures that the only way to move forward is through collaboration and participation. He also understood that If he really wants Bitcoin to scale and fulfill its potential, which will be uncovered in the coming years, he has to remove himself from it. Perhaps taking lessons from Jimmy and Wikipedia. About a year ago, Satoshi Nakamoto was ranked among the50 richest people in the worldas notedQuartz. Oh man, could you imagine? Immeasurable wealth at the palm of your hands, and yet we don’t know who he is andnone of his funds have been moved, Satoshi, just like Jimmy, gave up personal gain for the success of the community. Rajneeshpuram In the early 1980s followers of who would later be namedOsho, erected a full city that housed over 7,000 people, an airport, hotel, and even an artificial lake. Check out theNetflixdocumentary —Wild wild countryI can’t recommend it enough. It really shows what a community can build and do if they have a shared goal/something in common and they feel joint ownership. By all measures, Rajneeshpuram was a successful community that accomplished incredible deeds. Eventually, though, both leaders, Shiela and Bhagwan, became corrupt, stopped serving their community and instead lead it to pursue their personal interests, and thus the community broke down. Such is the fate of communities with powerful leaders that fall for personal incentives. There are many other examples which I did not include. For example, the fundamentals of religion are also based on such things. But they are piled with layers of personal interest and gain which have tainted the base layer of spirituality, which I think is an important part of the human experience. While leaders are vital to the formation of the community if the community is to scale and reach its potential that leader(s) has to remove himself from omnipotence, forfeit power, and allow the community to take charge. When there is no single point of authority, power, or ownership when members of the community feel equal and the power to influence the community through action, contribution, and collaboration, that is a true community. With the connection opportunities of the internet such decentralized communities, like Wikipedia and Bitcoin, can grow into world-changing movements, improving the lives of their participants, contributors, and even ‘lurkers’ — most people just use Wikipedia, they don’t contribute. What other communities can be built? The possibilities are endless and our imagination is the only limit. In the next part… We will talk about why does this happen, anthropologically and philosophically. Why do positions of power change human behavior, and what can we do to change that? The clue lies in the last of thefive good emperors,Marcus Aurelius, a personal exemplar of mine. The most powerful person during his time and yet a just and righteous leader.Shane Parrish’s has a superbintroductionto him Hi there, My name is Eylon, If you like the nonsense that I write, give me a few (50!) claps and follow me!

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/rpa-and-the-future-of-work-77ffb21df08f?source=tag_archive---------90-----------------------,RPA and the Future of Work,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Rob King Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share There is seemingly a contradiction around the impact RPA is having on people and jobs. On one hand, you have the claims that by solution providers that jobs are not being lost, while other industry commentators claim that the benefits cannot be achieved without loss of jobs. What is the truth of the situation? Can they both be correct? Is it possible both scenarios are actually correct and not entirely contradictory? Let’s start with the optimistic view that automation simply eliminates the mundane tasks and provides the opportunity for more creative, complex and challenging new opportunities. This is explicitly describing that the nature of work will be changing. This is nothing new, in my experience, the advances in technology have been changing my job throughout my entire career. Furthermore, both in the USA and UK the current levels of unemployment are at the lowest we’ve seen for decades. Japan faces an even more challenging situation where the population is in decline and therefore even filling existing roles as workers retire is an impossible task. At this early stage of development, the evidence points to RPA not having a significant impact on job losses. That’s not to say there are no winners and losers in this equation, as some industries clearly find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on cutting costs; staff and buildings being the top two savings opportunities. Let’s look at the pessimistic view that millions of jobs will be lost through automation. These predictions often qualify their statements with two important caveats: the first being that they are existing jobs; the second is the long timeframe for these predictions. Accepting these two caveats, these statements — as far as any predictions of the future can be — are likely also true. the think tank Centre for London warned that almost one-third of jobs in London have high potential to be carried out by machines within the next 20 years the think tank Centre for London warned that almost one-third of jobs in London have high potential to be carried out by machines within the next 20 years What happens in the middle years is interesting. Since most predictions talk in 15-year timeframes, let’s look back at how work has changed since 2004: Facebookhas just rolled out to a few college students. By 2017 it’s income had reached $40 Billion. Not to mention that social media generally now has 3 billion active users. iPodwas THE gadget to own. It was the start of a whole new way of consuming music, that has advanced to streaming. Music streaming now accounts for 75% of music industry revenue and is worth nearly $4 Billion. Mobile phoneinnovation was the flip handset. iPhone and Android and the smartphone revolution were still a few years away. Today the smartphone market is considered to be worth $355 Billion! Add to that the spending on the Google and Apple App Stores is thought to be in the region of $40 Billion. Netflixhad reached 1 million subscribers but was still a few years away from launching its streaming service. Today it has 137 million subscribers and an income of $11 Billion. The purpose of these examples is simply to demonstrate how much can happen in 15 years and while old jobs will certainly decline, new jobs will be created. Both pessimistic and optimistic statements about the impact of RPA are true, and in the middle new jobs we can only guess about will appear. My personal view is optimistic that the net impact of automation will not result in a loss of jobs but we will see the breadth of jobs change as radically as we have experienced in the last 15 years.",Rob King,https://medium.com/@WizardRob?source=post_page---byline--77ffb21df08f---------------------------------------,12,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png,2019-01-14T15:03:58.625Z,Medium
https://medium.com/robotmissions/robot-missions-top-10-moments-from-2018-f6925f0695af?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,Robot Missions Top 10 Moments from 2018,10. Artist in Residence at MadeMill,"Erin RobotGrrl Follow RobotMissions -- Listen Share Hello robot friends! It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test, to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence. This will be a year to remember. Not only in the progress made, but in the ways we witnessed the community rally together to help support our cause and make the vision a reality. This will be a year to remember. Not only in the progress made, but in the ways we witnessed the community rally together to help support our cause and make the vision a reality. What we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community. I’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure, then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point, it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far. Going through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back, it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions. Of course, there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly, there were also sad moments this year. We will learn from these and strive to improve in 2019. We’re fortunate that it was difficult to narrow down this list to only 10 moments. With that said,here are the top 10 Robot Missions moments of 2018: 10. Artist in Residence at MadeMill This is what really spring-boarded it all. Being able to work for three weeks on Robot Missions un-distracted at MadeMill allowed us to dream about what can be possible. At MadeMill, it was a one of its kind environment where you are surrounded with many cool resources in the form of fabrication tools and knowledgable experts. We learned more, and experimented with waterjet cutting metal pieces for the robot. Using this tech, we made wheels that were much bigger than what would have been feasible on our smaller 3D printer. The experience culminated in running a Robo-Obstacle course at the Canadian Science and Technology Museum, with two robots that were operational! Luckily from this three week experience, I was invited to join the team as an electronics designer. Without a doubt, this significantly changed the orbit of Robot Missions — opening many new amazing possibilities and opportunities. Incredibly thankful for this. 9. Stakeholders, Demonstrations, Presentations! Engaging with stakeholders through demonstrations, presentations, and more — It’s such an honour when important people lend their time to hear about what we are working on with Robot Missions. Even more significant, is when that person helps champion your initiative. One shining example of this was with Councillor Jeff Leiper, who helped with getting the approval for our initiative to take place on Westboro Beach in the summer, and joined in many times during the summer when we were working on the project and robots. We couldn’t have asked for a better person to help with this! Additional highlights include meeting Minister Kirsty Duncan, Minister Catherine McKenna, Mayor Jim Watson, winning an Awesome Foundation award, presenting at the Innovators and Entrepreneurs series at SDTC, being highlighted during the uOttawa Women in Tech event and meeting the VP of Amazon AWS, and more. Plus, a fond memory of when Megan Smith gave a shoutout to Robot Missions during her keynote at OCE Discovery. All of these give more awareness to Robot Missions, which helps us broaden our reach — so we very much appreciate it. 8. Crowd-sourced robot in 48 hours To start off, we weren’t entirely sure that this would or would not be possible. For the Hackaday Supercon in Pasadena, CA, we asked attendees ahead of time if they have a 3D printer and if they could print some robot parts to replicate a Bowie robot. It was really amazing that there were people who were willing to contribute print time and filament to the build! On the Friday, the build started, and continued throughout Saturday. Time management could have probably been better. This was all leading up to the workshop, similar to a Field Test, which was on Sunday. With the help of volunteers at Supercon with assembling the robot, we were able to get the robot going just in the nick of time with 30 minutes to spare! The workshop, Environmental Robotics BioBlitz was attended by a dozen or so hardware hackers who are also interested in tackling environmental challenges. The Hackaday Supercon provided a great place to test this crowd-sourced build, and test the robot. Bowie was able to pick up a chip bag! A big thank you to everyone who helped out to make this possible! 7. uOttawa Engineering Design class Working with the University of Ottawa introduction to engineering design class students for two semesters has been interesting! It’s really amazing to provide the robot as a platform to the students, and see what they would develop as modules to tackle an environmental challenge or to improve the capability of the robot. The groups that were able to do multiple prototype iterations in the semester developed functional modules. It was impressive for a first year class. In the first semester one group decided to tackle water sampling with Bowie. The module they made was great, and functioned to collect three individual water samples. The following semester, one group decided to tackle the challenge of making Bowie into a water skimmer. They made an area for Bowie to ‘sit’ on a buoyant platform (which also used recycled 2L pop bottles). This shows that the students did build on each others work, as the project in the first semester could be used by the project in the second semester. The idea worked! These were just two of the several interesting projects that helped push the functionality forwards. Many thanks to University of Ottawa for helping the students collaborate with Robot Missions! 6. Technical achievements with robots There was a lot of work put in to coding the robots and upgrading them this season. We managed to have three robots working, each of them with their own specialty. We were able to get 3D printed tank treads rolling on the robot — though to our surprise they ended up working better just rolling on the sprockets! For navigating autonomously, we encountered difficulties using the standard GPS + IMU approach on the sandy terrain. This meant it was necessary to change the approach! We went with using augmented reality markers, where the robot could visually detect the marker and navigate within a square. We got Tensorflow up and running on the Raspberry Pi, trained the dataset, and were able to get three sub-systems to talk to each other in order for the robot to successfully scoop when it detected debris. Wow! We had imagined this, and now this year an early version of it became reality. Also, who can forget when we modified Bowie to be able to apply lipstick?! 5. Field Test at a very cool special location This one is still secret, but you’ll hear about this in the new year! ;) 4. Deploying the purple Catalyst Pod (made by prototypeD Team) Deploying the Pod onto Westboro Beach was a dream come true. An off-grid solar powered work station to serve as the Robot Missions HQ during the summer. This was made possible thanks to prototypeD Team. They put in the hard work to make the design, construct it, and fit it up so it looked stellar on the interior. Thanks to them for allowing us to use the Pod and paint it purple. The Pod was a beacon when we were on the beach. Folks on the beach would come up to ask if we were selling ice cream or surfboards? Nope. :D This is mission control centre to the beach cleaning robots! Good times were had painting it purple (even Councillor Jeff Leiper stopped by to lend a hand and his painting expertise!), spray painting the designs, the installation, and working inside of it during the summer. We wish it was still here with us today. I miss it. It would have been cool to put lights on it for the holidays. The fond experiences of it on the beach and working on the robots inside keep its memory alive. 3. Season Finale Field Test It was so humbling to see participants join us on a beautiful day for our season finale Field Test and celebrate the progress made during the summer. Considering the start of the season Field Test was in pouring rain(a handful of people did come out to this, which was amazing), this was a fitting finish! We had all three robots operating, did a few demonstrations of the AI, and discussed with people the progress made and what some of the current limitations are. This was a blast, and thank you to everyone who joined in, it was wonderful to see folks come again who visited previously in the summer, and meet folks who were new to the initiative! 2. Robot Demo to the Prime Minister Wow, this was such an honour to meetPrime Minister Justin Trudeauand share Robot Missions with him. During the demonstration, Yellow Bowie scooped up a crumpled paper ball on the floor (representing trash) and opened its lid to deposit it into the hopper. It was quite the feeling to see everyone applaud when this happened! Afterwards, the Prime Minister even drove the robot! Hearing how he was aware that 3D printing was ubiquitous was fantastic. It is a great highlight, especially as an inventor, to have your project recognised. This helps introduce Robot Missions to a national stage now, and strengthens the recognition as an initiative. I personally don’t think I will forget this for a million years. Thank you to those who made this possible, namely MadeMill for featuring us. 1. YOU! Participants, the team, people who helped with workshops and Field Tests, and valuable mentors and advisors. You’re the motivation that keeps us going. We’ve met many of you through the Field Tests this summer, and it has been a pleasure to share the robots with you(even when the robots were being difficult). It’s amazing when you get to hear tidbits of the initiative from other people — one we heard was that the robots on the beach was the ‘sensation of the summer’. I still can’t believe that at the Westboro Beach closing, we had peoplelining upto play with the robot! We used every last volt possible in the batteries that evening. :) It really means a lot that the community enjoyed our project! We aim to make an impact in the community and the local environment with robots. The critical bit is all of you — and without, this would simply not be possible. As well, a personal big thank you to those who have been generous with their time to mentor and advise. Shoutout to my mentors Leah L, Chris B, Jason A, Olivia P, Andrew P, Brenda B — you’ve helped more than you would know. The learning opportunities have been tremendous and have been endowed through your guidance. Thank you!! Bonus— Weirdest item Bowie collected: half of a pair of dentures!

Madrigal Follow The Atlantic -- 7 Share More than a thousand days after the water problems in Flint, Michigan, became national news, thousands of homes in the city still have lead pipes, from which the toxic metal can leach into the water supply. To remedy the problem, the lead pipes need to be replaced with safer, copper ones. That sounds straightforward, but it is a challenge to figure out which homes have lead pipes in the first place. The City’s records are incomplete and inaccurate. And digging up all the pipes would be costly and time-consuming. That’s just the kind of problem that automation is supposed to help solve. So volunteer computer scientists, with some funding from Google,designed a machine-learning modelto help predict which homes were likely to have lead pipes. The artificial intelligence was supposed to help the City dig only where pipes were likely to need replacement. Through 2017, the plan was working. Workers inspected 8,833 homes, and of those, 6,228 homes had their pipes replaced — a 70 percent rate of accuracy. Heading into 2018, the City signed a big, national engineering firm,AECOM, to a $5 million contract to “accelerate” the program, holding a buoyant…",Alexis C.

https://medium.com/swlh/the-vc-backed-startup-solving-education-17da5cf5201f?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,The VC-Backed Startup Solving Education,"Optimised learning, powered by AI and cognitive science","Miruna Girtu Follow The Startup -- Listen Share The challenge of education is complex. How can the knowledge and skills of an expert be deconstructed into a format that can be understood by a novice, and then built up in a way that transforms the novice into an expert? How to ensure genuine retained understanding, memory, ability and transferrable intelligence? And how to do it at scale? “This is only possible by combining effective instruction (teaching), cognitive science and neuroscience, and technology (artificial intelligence) — in one solution,” summarizes Guy Riese, Forbes 30 under 30, CEO and CoFounder ofUp Learn. “If you take just one of those you can have a good product. If you take two, it can be great. If you take all three and do it right, you solve education.” It all started when Riese fell ill at the beginning of his A Levels and missed an entire term. Keen not to move down a year, he searched the internet for ways to catch up and came across research on effective learning in the field of cognitive science. He applied these insights to his studies and rose from below average grades to top of his year in Maths, Chemistry, and Physics. He went on to achieve straight A*s, scoring 100% in Physics and secured a place at Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering. Riese then graduated with 1st Class Honours and a dissertation on Machine Learning. “The secret to my success, and why some students get A*s, whilst others get Cs and Ds, has not been because ofwhatI’ve learnt, it’s beenhow.” I founded Up Learn to create a system for making the most effective learning experience in the world accessible to all”. Optimised learning, powered by AI and cognitive science Up Learn is building a product that delivers education success at scale, starting with A Levels. It consolidates thousands of learning resources in one system. The content created by Up Learn teachers is fuelled by research into cognitive science, which ensures its efficiency and efficacy. As a student starts going through the content, Up Learn’s AI continuously analyses their strengths, weaknesses, and behaviour at a granular level, and uses the insights to direct them to the most important lesson, quiz or activity for them to do next, until they reach 90% in every topic. Throughout the process, students have access to live on-demand tutoring and to videos that simulate real-life lessons. To support the latter, Up Learn has built its own animation capability that produces high-quality videos at low cost and is open for other businesses to use. Guaranteed results or money back Over the past two years, 97% of the students who completed Up Learn courses have achieved A*–A grades. Confident in the effectiveness of its proprietary approach, Up Learn guarantees that its students will achieve an A-A* grade upon completion of its online course, or their money back — a potentially risky decision for a business that caters to thousands of different types of students. “This is a widespread misconception throughout society when thinking about intelligence and education. If I asked you, how could you possibly know that an antibiotic is going to kill bacteria in everyone? What would you say? Science. These treatments are studied against controls to determine how effective they are. And some treatments can get very close to 100%,” Riese explains. “It can work just the same for education. We use scientific methods to study the effectiveness of our education treatments. And that’s how we can get such results with certainty and guarantee outcomes at scale.” Fighting inequality The uncomfortable truth is that, according to anAnnual Reportpublished by the Education Policy Institute in the U.K., by the end of primary school, children from low-income families are 9.4 months behind on average — a gap that grows to 18.4 months by the time they leave secondary education. Up Learn is not free to use — it charges per school year per subject. Riese is aware that not everyone will be able to afford it and has a solution. “Making the most effective education solution only available to those who can afford it would only worsen the existing inequality in education and further reduce social mobility. For that reason, we have set a goal — for every student who pays for Up Learn, we provide a course free to a student who can’t. We offer an unlimited number of freescholarshipsto students who meet one of our set criteria. Last year, about 25% of the students enrolled in Up Learn were on these scholarships — something we are very proud of.” The end of exams Up Learn’s mission is to solve education as a whole. “For example, in the future, Up Learn could deliver the entire curriculum learning and assessment component of education. It’s unnecessary for students to sit the actual exam — we have already determined their grade. Students currently might take a two-hour exam, once a year. Instead, we collect over a hundred hours of learning and assessment data, continuously. Once the student reaches A* level, we could, in theory, issue their grade. Without an exam and without any stress. It becomes about completing the learning — actually having the knowledge and skills — instead of how you perform on a specific day with specific questions. ” Investing in education Reflecting both the existing challenges and the opportunities in the EdTech space, investment activity is at an all-time high, with international funding reaching a new record of$10.58 Billionin investment in the first three quarters of 2018. The EdTech market is projected to grow at 17.0% per annum, to$252 Billion by 2020. Riese started the company with personal funds, selling his first company when still at university, along with a Young Innovators award from CVC Capital Partners. It was then bootstrapped from there to first revenue. Up Learn has since raised over $3 Million in seed funding, investors includingForward Partners, SyndicateRoom’sGrowth Fundand a number of high profile private investors. Luke Smith, Investor at Forward Partners comments “In a world where the majority of new jobs being created require high skill levels, education is increasingly important in our shared success. And as a parent of young children, I’ve experienced the appetite to invest in my children’s future first hand. But tech’s impact on education has been more limited than you might expect. Over the past few years, the use of AI and technologies like personalised learning have received a lot of attention (and VC funding) but adoption has been slow. Equally, many of these businesses have struggled to gain momentum due to long, careful sales cycles from the educational institutions. Against this background, we’re delighted to reveal our investment in a company that we think will transform education by avoiding some of these pitfalls, and quickly bring better educational outcomes to the masses.” Read more about Forward’s investment into Up Learnhere. The typical strategy in education is focusing on just one specific component. Under this scenario, Riese believes that solving education would only be possible if every company and organisation solving the individual components collaborated and connected with an unprecedented level of transparency and perfect cohesion. He sees that as an unlikely outcome. “The only way to tackle the entire challenge of education is by doing a number of different things — all the components of it — and doing them really well. This is hard, but ultimately the most valuable problem to be solving.” This ambitious goal can still be highly focused. “We’re not trying to build 100 different features; we’re trying to build the one feature that solves 100 different problems.” Up Learn is driven by a belief that a complete and effective solution will lead to a future where every motivated student succeeds, qualifications are earned in less time and people are better equipped to contribute to a growing economy.

He graduated from Indiana University in 2000 with a BS in Marketing and Entrepreneurship. In his free time, Jim enjoys playing golf and raising his three kids, Cate (10), Thomas (8), and James (6) with his wife of 14 years Joey, who is also a Kelley Business School graduate. Before getting involved with the automotive side of the family business, he worked in his grandfather’s grain trading company based in Eastern Europe. While there, Jim received a MSc in International Trade and Transport. Give us an elevator pitch about your company. I work in our family business,Kelley Automotive Group, that was founded August 21, 1952. We will never forget that date because my grandfather bought his first car dealership the day my dad, Tom Kelley, was born. We are based out of Fort Wayne, IN and currently operate 8 dealerships in the Fort Wayne area that sell 10,000 cars a year. We sell new BMW, Cadillac, Volvo, Buick, GMC, Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, RAM, Jeep, and Chrysler brands. What are some exciting projects that your company is working on right now or in the future? Currently we are embarking on the largest project our company has ever seen. Four of our dealerships (BMW, Volvo, Cadillac, and Buick GMC) will be relocating over the next three years to a 50 acre parcel of land on the corner of Indiana 14 and I-69. This $50 million project will include a state of the art Body Shop and Detail/Accessory center as well. We start construction January 2019 and will be completed with all four stores by the Fall of 2021. Why did you want to pursue entrepreneurship/business? What are some highlights of your efforts? I grew up always wanting to work with my dad and grandfather. I remember as a kid going to dealer events and watch my dad and grandfather interact with other dealers and management from the manufacturers. I would see how much they enjoyed what they did and I wanted the same. When you were a student at Indiana University, what were some useful entrepreneurial resources or experiences? I felt going through the Kelley School of Business was in itself a great learning experience. Many of the classes, especially the I-Core semester, taught me to work with others. Up until then school was on an individual basis and during I-Core, a major portion was spent in a team environment. Same for what I do today, I always rely on a team to succeed. Whether it’s the service, sales, or parts team, we all work together to reach our individual and department goals. What are other useful entrepreneurial resources or experience outside of the University? Spending time right after graduation working for what I consider one of the best entrepreneurs I have ever met, my grandfather. I spent four years working at our family’s grain trading company, Trans-Oil, that was based out of the Eastern European country, Moldova. Starting in the mid 1990’s my grandfather took an opportunity of trading a small amount of grain, 3–5,000 tons to over a million tons of grain a year. In addition, working with my dad has taught me so much not just about the automotive business but business in general. What’s was your favorite failure or learning experience? Time kills deals. There were a few times early in my career I would procrastinate on a deal and quickly learned that to be successful I needed to take advantage of the opportunity right away. What’s the best advice you’ve received in your career? Surround yourself with the best people possible. We work in a business where all manufacturers make great product and it really is people that make the difference. What advice would you give to students interested in entrepreneurship? Have confidence in yourself and get real world experience. Although we don’t operate the grain trading company anymore I’ll never forget my experiences from that business which I still incorporate today. ​ Where can people find you in-person? Online? I’m in my actual office at Tom Kelley Buick GMC a few times per week, but I am mainly working at our different locations. I am onInstagramand onLinkedIn.

https://medium.com/sap-innovation-spotlight/understanding-your-customers-experience-are-you-in-orbit-or-just-flying-by-e2f04c53a21d?source=tag_archive---------91-----------------------,Understanding Your Customer’s Experience: Are You in Orbit or Just Flying By?,Published inSAP Innovation Spotlight,"James Marland Follow SAP Innovation Spotlight -- Listen Share The experience economy dictates that we get to know our customers intimately, not just execute a “fly-by”. We’ve all been transfixed by the amazing precision of the New Horizons spacecraft in locating an object the size of Manhattan 4 Billion miles away. Even more staggering is the fact that it is a one-shot deal, a fly-by which can never be repeated. But this week saw another spacecraft in final maneuvers: Osiris-Rex went into orbit around an asteroid where it will spend a leisurely two years in orbit. The spacecraft will take high-resolution images of every square inch of the asteroid. During the summer of 2020, the spacecraft will briefly touch the surface to retrieve a sample and is scheduled to deliver the sample to Earth in September 2023. This got me thinking about the way that companies engage with their customers in the Experience Economy. Are you executing a fly-by, or really getting into a close orbit with your customers? Are you executing a fly-by, or really getting into a close orbit with your customers? Most companies engage with their customers just once, at the point of sale. Perhaps through a simple survey which in a follow-up email, which most customers ignore — I know I do. A more sophisticated approach may be through a loyalty card program, but that tends to focus on just the transnational nature of the interaction. What did the customer buy, how much did they pay. Neither of these approaches allow the deeper questions to be asked, such as — “Why did the customer buy?” — “How did we do in meeting their expectations?” — “How could we improve?” These questions remain unasked and unanswered. It’s as though a New Horizons scientist, after seeing an image of the surface of the rock, asks “can we zoom is a bit closer”? No, you can’t: the spacecraft is already millions of miles away. In the same way, a Customer Service Manager can’t ask a follow-up question such as “Did Mrs Jones bring her husband to the store that day?” Mrs Jones has left the building and is now miles away. The mission planners on Osiris Rex had the luxury of a much closer object, shorter radio lag and more fuel, so they could design their mission very differently. Different orbital trajectories can be programmed as the scientists learn more about the asteroid, every angle will be photographed, conflicting data can be corrected. This is the type of close relationship that companies need with their ever more demanding and fickle consumers, yet at the same time balancing that with their concerns about privacy and their desire that brands that they engage with should “not be creepy”. Osiris Rex had a very different mission profile than New Horizons, which had a trajectory built for speed and distance. It didn’t have the fuel to stop and get into orbit with Pluto, Charon and other bodies as it zoomed past. NASA had to make a trade-off between the two approaches. In the Experience Economy, it’s not just about what you know, but your ability to act on that insight with confidence and speed. In the Experience Economy, it’s not just about what you know, but your ability to act on that insight with confidence and speed. Think about ways that companies try to understand their customers, suppliers or employees. Most tools show broad feedback but lack precision and speed. The timely process of surveys and manual feedback collection can take months to collect and analyze data. By the time decisions are made and products fixed, it is too late. It can feel like a scientist staring wistfully at New Horizons receding into the distance wishing “if only I had asked that question a bit differently”. At SAP we believe the next evolution of enterprise applications has begun with a real-time connection between the system of action and the system of record. You need both the trajectory to visit all of your customers, yet at the same time the ability to develop deep relations with them so you can deliver the experience they want. No longer do companies have to make a choice between the fly-by and the close orbit.

https://medium.com/pushtostart/all-tech-projects-run-over-budget-change-our-mind-a16dd6076c98?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"All Tech Projects run over budget, change our mind.",Why you should triple your budget,"Why you should triple your budget Wendy Dean Follow pushtostart -- 2 Listen Share When I first started out in the tech industry, my first boss gave me a nice tip. “Whatever they quote you… triple it.” “Whatever they quote you… triple it.” At the time I thought he was insane. Triple it?! Sure I knew that sometimes projects run a little over budget, but triple? I was young, incredulous, and naive — in my own arrogance, I ignored his advice. Two months later, I was sitting across from him in our executive conference room.Had I experienced insane success and been promoted to an executive position, all in 2 months? No, I had horribly failed as the project I was working on ran more than 3 times over the budget, with no end in sight. I was thankful to still have my job, and passing off the project to my boss so he could cover our losses. At the time, I learned two lessons. First, that I should take advice from industry veterans. And second, that all tech projects run over budget. In my experience there are usually three core reasons why projects run over budget: feasibility, failure to account for issues related to development, and technical debt. Feasibility This is the issue most often plaguing software development. It starts the same everytime — you meet with other members, they quote you the time and cost they think it will take to finish it. The main issue here is that, usually, they quote based on how fast the project would go without being bogged down by reviews, changes, and technical debt (more on this later). To make things worse, you’ll then go to management, who will halve all estimates. You’ll argue that this much isn’t feasible, but they’ll say some buzzwords (most notably “agile” and “sprint”) and shoo you out. Then you meet with marketing, which was supposed to meet with the software engineers last week but didn’t. They’ll ask a bunch of conceptual questions that border on philosophical — “not what is the product, why is the product?” — and you walk out a little confused, but confident in branding. But tonight one of them will have an amazing new, innovative idea for how to position the product — and in a week they’ll be pushing something that isn’t even on the roadmap. The Client Another obvious issue lies in accounting for issues related to development, especially unseen ones. How do you account for the unforeseeable? As a rule of thumb, every time you think something might go wrong, assume it will.In software, something will ALWAYS go wrong.My developers have a running joke with a calendar on the wall: “days since bug.”That number never has and never will exceed 0. And then of course, there’s theclient. The client comes to you with an idea —they know what they want and need you to make it. For those of you industry veterans that just did a double take on that last line, don’t worry,I was just kidding! The client absolutelydoesn’t knowwhat they want. There will be a dozen changes to the spec, several pivots and new features, and complaints when you build what they asked for but it doesn’t look as good in real life as it did in their head. Technical Debt And then there’s technical debt. What is Technical Debt and what forms does it take? Well, in general, Technical Debt arises from rushed projects and issues related to development. According to Techopedia: Technical debtis a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. Technical debtis a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. For all you software devs, this will sound very familiar. It’s the cost that arises from when you runnpm install xyzandthe developer behind it stops updating xyz.It’s the cost that arises when you write that one-liner at 4pm on a Friday and knock the ball out of the park, but it starts slowing down the app and increasing server load above 10 users. For more on Technical Debt, there’s a nice piece by Tomer Dicturel explaining where we are and where we’re going that has been trending for the past few weeks on Medium: AI: the silver bullet to stop Technical Debt from sucking you dry You’ve heard a lot about student debt, but what about technical debt? towardsdatascience.com This is more of an open-ended question. Every project is different and, to some extent, requires its own special solution. In general though, I’ve found thatproperly allocating a budget that takes into account failurewill save you hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road in frantic panic. Next time you get quoted $8000 and 7 days to build your app, stop and think: is this an accurate estimate? Rome wasn’t built in a day, nor was it built in a week for a couple grand — your app will most likely cost multiples of that quote, and you should expect that. We found that most projects quoted at lower estimates (usually by freelancers) run over budget and never get completed —that’s an 88% non-completion rate. So we collected more data — data on successful projects, that were completed and reached some level of success.We found that most projects hit a cost (not a budget — we took into account the final cost) between $160k and $180k. At first thought this may seem insanely high, but these are the costs associated with developing long-term, sustainable tech. To make your life a little easier, we built out a calculator too — one that’ll properly budget your app for success.

https://medium.com/@gordybal/sensory-porn-is-taking-over-the-internet-and-corrupting-our-children-7f559bd815ad?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,Sensory Porn Is Taking Over The Internet And Corrupting Our Children,Written byGordy Bal,"Gordy Bal Follow -- 1 Listen Share “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.”— Albert Einstein “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” — Albert Einstein This time of year, it feels blatantly more obvious how much time we spend with technology. It’s also a time where we reflect on the past year, and aim to make changes for the next that will improve our lives. In this age of social media, we have more platforms than ever targeting us with ads and messages. On one hand, it’s an amazing opportunity for awesome brands to get their name out to consumers who actually have thewant and needfor their products. But on the other hand, there are more subtle sales tactics being used to target the younger audience, that not only manipulate thoughts, but actually alter our body and brain chemistry. Scary, I know. When my 6 year old son said he wanted to watch a YouTube video that he’d seen at his friends, I was curious and obliging. After some digging, he found the one, and played it for me. My immediate reaction was confusion, followed by concern. See for yourself. When I saw this, I got a serious case of the heebie jeebies. Firstly, I’d never seen my child quite so captivated by anything (let alone someone unwrapping a toy). And secondly, I could immediately tell there was a tactic being used to cause this captivation in such a young, susceptible mind. That’s when I recalled hearing aboutAutonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Also known on the internet asASMR. Which I notedcoincidentallyappears directly in this Youtube channels name - AWESMR kids. A channel that has over 4.9M subscribers and over 3.5 BILLION video views. “Boredom, rooted in a fundamental discomfort with the self, is one of the least tolerable mental states.”— Gabor Mate “Boredom, rooted in a fundamental discomfort with the self, is one of the least tolerable mental states.” — Gabor Mate ASMR isan experience characterized by a tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine.In simpler terms, it’s a pleasurable physical reaction caused by a sound stimuli. When searched on the Google, top results include: Gentle Whispering ASMR ASMR Helping You Fall Asleep In Bed ASMR Ear Massage and Brushing Although a fairly new internet phenomena, the actual cause and effect of ASMR is nothing new. In fact, Craig Richard, PhD and author ofBrain Tingles: The Secret to Triggering Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response for Improved Sleep, Stress Relief, and Head-to-Toe Euphoria, thinks it’s a genetic response that’s designed to mitigate stress hormones and help us feel relaxed. So much so, that ASMR has been coined as the “Brain Orgasm”. That made me curious — what happens when you continuously stimulate this neurological pleasure response unnaturally? In a survey led by Dr. Richard, 40% of 19,000 respondents reported that their experiences from watching ASMR had decreased or gone away overtime. The same way pornography stimulates a response in the body that would naturally be promoted by sex, ASMR stimulates a response in the body that would be naturally promoted by an experience, such as a mother soothing their child, or brushing their hair. And just like pornography, it appears that desensitization is a common result of overstimulation, killing the “Brain Orgasm” for many ASMR fans. It’s becoming seemingly more difficult to distinguish pleasure and pain. I, myself struggle with knowing that a lot of today’s wellness “trends” are so new, we have no idea what they’re actually doing to our mental and physical health. And more importantly, our children’s — especially when they are still growing and in a fundamental time of brain development. As a huge believer in the Quantified Self Movement, I’m interested in self-knowledge through self-tracking. I encourage using technology for the benefit of humanity and am a supporter of many technologies that are not only improving our mental, emotional, physical and spiritual wellbeing, but the wellbeing of the planet. And yetresearchis showing that there’s no way around it —screen time damages the brain, and in turn has detrimental impact on mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. “Much of the damage occurs in the brain’s frontal lobe, which undergoes massive changes from puberty until the mid-twenties. Frontal lobe development, in turn, largely determines success in every area of life — from sense of well-being to academic or career success to relationship skills.” “Much of the damage occurs in the brain’s frontal lobe, which undergoes massive changes from puberty until the mid-twenties. Frontal lobe development, in turn, largely determines success in every area of life — from sense of well-being to academic or career success to relationship skills.” Think back to sugar. When we were growing up, our parents unknowingly subjected us to it through unlimited cereals, cookies, soft drinks, etc. Only now is research showing the devastating impact it has on brain health, diabetes and heart disease, not to mention it’s extremely addictive nature. The equivalent will be true with screen time — in 30 years from now, research will begin to show more clearly just how damaging excess screen time is on mental, emotional and physical health. And the children who grew up glued to the screen will be disadvantaged, the same way the ones who ate unlimited sugar are. Although seemingly harmless, these addictive ASMR videos are desensitizing us from natural pleasure and altering our brain chemistry. The statistics are shocking, and yet its not surprising. Unlimited content is now at our children’s fingertips, and it’s targeting them in an extremely manipulative and addictive way. In an article titled “Youtube’s Dark Side Could Be Affecting Your Child’s Mental Health” a clear chart shows the percentage of children choosing the unknown and unlimited world Youtube over structured TV. We are moving towards a world where we have little to no control over technology and its effects on us. Not only is it being used to catch our attention, but it’s being used to alter our physical chemistry and the way we see the world.And it seems like the people with the most fear and caution around the technology we use every day are the ones who are creating it. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are two examples of parents who limit their children’s screen time. Just this alone is reason enough to question the devices that have become an extension of our bodies and consume so much of our time. “The most important part about tomorrow is not the technology or the automation, but that man is going to come into entirely new relationships with his fellow men. He will retain much more in his everyday life of what we term the naïveté and idealism of the child. I think the way to see what tomorrow is going to look like is just to look at our children.”— R. Buckminster Fuller “The most important part about tomorrow is not the technology or the automation, but that man is going to come into entirely new relationships with his fellow men. He will retain much more in his everyday life of what we term the naïveté and idealism of the child. I think the way to see what tomorrow is going to look like is just to look at our children.” — R. Buckminster Fuller It’s not completely hopeless. The more awareness we have around what’s happening, the more we can control its effect on us and the people we love.Especially our children. Children are a blank canvas, yet they come into the world with a knowing far greater than we give them credit for. Very quickly, children learn what is good for them and what is harmful. They also watch and listen to us closely, and pick up on our behaviours. Have you ever said something while your child was in the room, not thinking about them being around. And then later that day they repeat that exact sentence or bring it up in another way? It’s not surprising really — Children’s brains are like sponges, ready to absorb whatever is in front of them. Children’s brains are like sponges, ready to absorb whatever is in front of them. Making it that much more important to be conscious of what we expose them to. And in turn, not only do we avoid having to sit through painfully numbing Youtube videos, but we also reap the benefits of making better choices for their lives. “Nature cures, not the physician” — Hippocrates “Nature cures, not the physician” — Hippocrates Too often we forget what is right in front of us. In a world where we have millions of videos at our fingertips, and a pocketful of games on our device at any second, it is easy to look past our true nature —Nature. But spending time outside is incredibly important for mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. There is even now a word that describes this innate instinct —Biophilia: The innate human need to connect with nature. And it’s not some far out idea; study after study shows that our disconnect from nature is causing an increase in anxiety and depression, as well as a slew of other physical and mental challenges. No wonder our children are experiencing mental health issues younger; we are replacing their natural instinct for connection with a stimulating screen. No wonder our children are experiencing mental health issues younger; we are replacing their natural instinct for connection with a stimulating screen. So it’s simple, choose nature! Next time you have an hour to spare or a week of holiday’s, choose to spend more of that time outside, connecting with your children and to nature. You may feel the cold more than your kids, but you will also experience this unbeatable joy of watching them interact in their most natural state. “Technology is, of course, a double edged sword. Fire can cook our food but also burn us.”— Jason Silva “Technology is, of course, a double edged sword. Fire can cook our food but also burn us.” — Jason Silva There’s no way to completely avoid exposure to technology and the internet. Even if there was, that wouldn’t be the answer. We are living in an age of exponential technology. It’s advancing faster than we can keep up with, making it that much more important to learn how to balance its effects. As our children’s exposure continues to grow, they will inevitably encounter things we wish they wouldn’t.That’s something we can learn to accept within ourselves, and trust in their values and innate knowing to guide the way. What we can do now, is protect our children’s physical and mental body, and instil healthy habits that they can grow with. I’m sure you’ve heard of blue light, and either feared it or brushed it off as nothing (no judgement either way). Here’s a simple explanation so you’re in the know. First of all, it’s everywhere — Sunlight is actually the main source of blue light (it also contains red, orange, yellow, green and every shade in between). But what we’re focused on here, is the manmade blue light coming from most of our devices. Although blue light is important in regulating our circadian rhythm, too much blue light late at night can disrupt this cycle, and cause trouble sleeping and daytime fatigue. Another key point about blue light is that our eyes are not very good at blocking it. It’s the shortest, yet highest energy wavelength, causing it to flicker more easily. This flickering leads to eye strain, headaches, mental and physical fatigue, and potential long-term loss of vision. Before the age of 10, children’s eyes are not fully developed and much more susceptible to the negative effects that come along with screen time,making it that much more important to protect them from the potentially harmful effects. Like I mentioned before, it’s too early in the game to know the exact effects, so precaution is always advised. Luckily, more and more conscious technology is coming out that can protect us and our children from these effects. So invest in blue light screen protectors for your devices or blue light glasses that your child can wear whenever they’re having screen time. Not only is this a physical layer of protection, but it becomes a conscious reminder of the time we spend on electronic devices. “This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”— Alan Watts “This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.” — Alan Watts It’s all too easy to give our children screen time as a way to get some peace and quiet at home or on the go — I do it too. But recently, I’ve found the quiet to be more disturbing than comforting. Seeing my children numb out to endless videos on a screen is incredibly disheartening, especially after seeing the stark contrast of joy and light on their faces when they’re physically playing games or outside. Not only do I find the numbing concerning, but now with Youtube, there is no way to filter the content they’re exposed to. I was shocked when I read about malicious content being uploaded on Youtube specifically directed to children, in the form of their favourite cartoons.There are thousands of these videos being uploaded daily, receiving millions of views by children, and Youtube can’t keep up with filtering the ones with exploitive content. Yes, it’s incredibly sad that this is the reality of our world to begin with. But it’s also a harsh reminder of our need for awareness, presence and raised consciousness. When it comes to my children and my own state of mind, the answer I’ve found most usefulis being present with them every day, including during screen time.Only watching videos when myself or my wife can watch too, and using this time for inquiry, exploration and curiosity. Not only does this ensure the content consumed is positive, but it brings a level of connection into an otherwise isolating activity. “If you finish all of your dinner, you can watch TV tonight”. “If you finish all of your dinner, you can watch TV tonight”. Have you ever heard a sentence like this come out of your mouth, and then immediately wished you hadn’t or felt some sort of guilt over using this tactic to get what you want? I’m not asking this to blame or guilt — I’m raising my hand right with you. Parenting is the hardest (and most rewarding) job, and technology seems to have made it slightly easier in exhaustive situations. Part of the work I’ve done on myself has revolved around understanding why I react in certain situations and what these triggers mean as an individual and a parent. And one thing I’ve come to know, is that it’s never about my child and always about something within me. Dr. Shefali puts it beautifully: May you be blessed with a child who defies you, so you may learn to release control.Who doesn’t listen, so you may learn to tune in.Who loves to procrastinate, so you learn beauty of stillness.Who forgets things, so you learn to let go of attachments.Who is extra-sensitive, so you learn to be grounded.Who is inattentive, so you learn to be focused.Who dares to rebel, so you learn to think outside the box.Who feels afraid, so you learn to trust the Universe.May you be blessed with a child who teaches you it is never about them, and all about you. May you be blessed with a child who defies you, so you may learn to release control. Who doesn’t listen, so you may learn to tune in. Who loves to procrastinate, so you learn beauty of stillness. Who forgets things, so you learn to let go of attachments. Who is extra-sensitive, so you learn to be grounded. Who is inattentive, so you learn to be focused. Who dares to rebel, so you learn to think outside the box. Who feels afraid, so you learn to trust the Universe. May you be blessed with a child who teaches you it is never about them, and all about you. If you’d hoped I would have an answer for a reward in replace of screen time, I don’t. But I do urge you to look within and see your children as the whole, complete beings they are. Ones who innately create science experiments out of the contents of your fridge, and turn cardboard boxes into spaceships. Ones who only need love to thrive, and yearn for connection with you and the world around them. Ones who innately create science experiments out of the contents of your fridge, and turn cardboard boxes into spaceships. Ones who only need love to thrive, and yearn for connection with you and the world around them. These are the future scientists and engineers and healers who will improve our planet. We can see this as a bad thing, or we can see this as the shift humanity needs to improve the future of the planet. A shift that starts with our children. “Children are one third of our population and all of our future.” “Children are one third of our population and all of our future.” Which leads me to questioning how the education system has remained the same as 100 years ago, when the world has changed so much? And why do we still put our children in a structure that was made to turn out factory workers? I dive deeper into these questions in a previous article titledThis Is How We’re Failing Our Children, but it’s a conversation I want to continue having for the future of our children. A conversation that led me to one of my greatest missions yet —creating a new paradigm school calledXploration Centre. Xploration Centre is built on the principles of Love, Nature and Emerging Technology, where every child is known and cherished for who they are; where the purpose of the entire curriculum is to cultivate the genius in every child and find ways for that genius to serve and benefit the community at large. Children learn key values such as critical thinking, collaboration, curiosity and consciousness, so that they become creative problem-solvers in the world that is emerging. In this way, they aren’t enslaved by technology, rather they learn how to work synergistically alongside it. If this newfound possibility is exciting for you, reach out — I’d love to hear from you! I’ve put together a cheat sheet with 12 easy to apply consciousness hacks that will put you in a state of abundance and flow. Your children will benefit too! Get the cheat sheet here! Let’s hear from you:I’d love to know what your experience has been when it comes to this?

https://medium.com/@denrooijen/have-data-want-impact-35899cb60d03?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"Have Data, Want Impact",Written byRyan den Rooijen,"Ryan den Rooijen Follow -- 1 Listen Share Organisations and individuals alike are realising that data — their data — has value. While data literacy has a long way to go, this is an important first step. Judicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management, increased financial security, and improved medical decisions, to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation, improve allocation of tax revenues, and define better policies and treaties, increasing overall happiness, transparency, and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity. If you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised, well,you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here. Firstly, we have difficulty at times recognising progress, instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommendFactfulness, theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters, and theNew York Times’ Week in Good News. The second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data, analytics, and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress, e.g.machine translationandcomplex board games. However, in others we are only in our infancy, and many organisations are not realising the value they could, both due to technical and behavioural hurdles. The question therefore is this: how can we move from simply having data to using it to deliver positive impact, and reducing the time it takes us to do so? I’m fortunate to have benefited greatly from my peers’ experiences, and I’m aiming to return the favour by sharing some of mine, starting this year. I’ll look to cover topics such as the data analytics ecosystem, hackathons & design thinking, practical AI applications, diversity & talent development, and organisational design. Suggestions or questions are always very welcome.

https://medium.com/@nathan.a.allen/a-i-apocalypse-averted-again-17581d235ece?source=tag_archive---------111-----------------------,"A.I. Apocalypse Averted,Again",Written byNathan Allen,"Nathan Allen Follow -- Listen Share Second Law of Thermodynamics, Kim Cattrall, and Chess-playing Midgets all in one essay. They said it couldn’t be done. Maybe it’s me, but when I see something like: I can’t help but think that’s but one part of the story, and maybe not even the most important part of the story.[1]This chart is of one output — but what about the other inputs and outputs? Generally, ML and particularly neural nets are ravenous beasts. Inputs include large amounts of data and hefty doses of power. This may seem trivial but recall than when the world went crypto-crazy a year ago, entire countries noted the power-usage spikes. That’s loads of powerful GPUs causing energy spikes on a national level. It’s not trivial. (This reminds me of Obama’s big EV push that established committees to review grid/power issues but no significant power-infrastructure investments — that’s how you knew they weren’t serious. Millions of EVs on the road … .where was the power going to come from?) Anyway, compared to humans, computers are remarkably inefficient — with both data and power. Humans can supplement inadequate data with imagination (I suppose one could draw an analogy to regressions, but computers fill-in-the-blanks poorly compared to humans and still require much more data). And the human brain is remarkably energy efficient. And what about the other output? Computers are entropy machines (physics-entropy, not computational-entropy, though that too).[2]They produce outputs per the graph (e.g.that’s a cat on a unicycle), and they produce heat. The thermal output of A.I. processes is not trivial. Further, as A.I. goes local, you localize these inefficiencies, which is why we have liquid-cooled chips in mobile phones now. More A.I. = more energy = more heat. And while chips have gained efficiencies all around, we’re getting to the limits of physics with 7nm chips (to the point where some fabs don’t even think producing at 7nm scale is worth doing). Ubiquitous and good AI depends on increasing efficiencies over the next decade to at least the same degree we’ve increased them over the past decade (probably more). Energy storage will likely improve, but I suspect we’re being unrealistic in assuming massive efficiency gains in other areas using the same technological architectures. Which brings us to the A.I. apocalypse. Humans are remarkably energy and data efficient, not to mention decent thermal regulators. But more importantly, humans make their own energy. This strikes me as a fundamental flaw in any “A.I. apocalypse” scenario, apart from a robot that has its own micro-nuclear reactor. AI requires non-trivial amounts of external power and produces non-trivial amounts of heat. If a robot goes crazy, you can almost certainly locate it and unplug it. What about a distributed apocalypse wherein bots seize the grid?Ok, unplug the grid. There are actual physical wires, you know. So you can’t watchHousewives of Burmafor a few weeks while we kill the bots. We’re talking about an apocalypse here. But won’t we need energy just to kill the bots?No, you’ll need an ax and maybe electrical gloves.Salt water may be handy, too. But if we did require electricity, we can power off of localized/non-grid energy sources. What about bots seizing a solar array?It would need to be a giant solar array, and bygiantI meaneasily targetable. Unplug it. Destroy it. Attack in early morning while the bots sleep. (Tesla’s Powerwall house battery tends to nearly no power in the early morning after powering the house through the night but before the sun re-energizes it, and this is in sunny climes). Combine the inefficiency of solar with the inefficiency of computers and I like our chances. If all else fails, humans can run into the woods, eat berries, and plan their revenge. Bots gotta stay plugged in. Strikes me as a strategic weakness.[3]Humans win again. Ultimately, we just like to ponder a human-level A.I. because humans want to be gods, and you become a god by creating humans. This story is as old as history; Ovid told the story of Pygmalion inMetamorphosestwo thousand years ago, and he didn’t even invent the story. (Pygmalion creates a statue that comes to life.) Mary Shelley (Frankenstein) and George Barnard Shaw (Pygmalion) followed up. As did Disney (Pinocchio), Broadway (My Fair Lady), Kim Cattrall (Mannequin) and nearly every Sci-Fi drama made. The idea that humans become gods by making “humans” is ancient.[4]Honestly, some of these examples seem more realistic than a distributed Alexa attack that compels humans to listen to unwanted weather reports. That said, nuclear drone submarines strike me as problematic. ******************************************************************* [1]From MIT Technology Review.https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612582/data-that-illuminates-the-ai-boom/# [2]I know … what about the curious case of quantum cooling/data deletion … well, we’re a long way from that having a practical application (long way = never).https://phys.org/news/2011-06-quantum-knowledge-cools-entropy.html [3]Throughout history, if you don’t have a source of fuel, your quest for domination quickly crumbles. (Fuel = food for humans and whatever for your horses or tanks or GPUs.) [4]Daedalus installed his voice into statues — sound familiar? Hephaestus famously made human-robots. Pandora was made from clay, and Talos made a man-robot out of bronze. All these stories are “B.C.” Of course, Amazon’s ‘Mechanical Turk’ is derived from an 18th century scammer who put a chess-playing midget in a box (seriously) to operate a robot. It’s noteworthy that the Mechanical Turk fooled people for years because they wanted to believe that humans could rise to god-level. That’s some serious Enlightenment-delirium.

A Gartner study last year found thatonly 26 percent of surveyed companies were successful with their IoT initiatives. This is an abysmal statistic, but it doesn’t surprise me given the many I’ve personally seen — many of which are purely operational or organizational. Although many issues associated with #IoT deployments aren’t technological, they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. || #IoTForAll @Leverege Click To Tweet Although many issues associated with IoT deployments aren’t technological, they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. And if every organization has to overcome these challenges in a void, a 74 percent failure rate is likely to continue. But here at Leverege, we believe in openly sharing the knowledge and insights that we’ve gained through our extensive experience, because it’s this open sharing of knowledge that will help us all to move forward together, collectively amplifying our human potential. So in this series, I’ll be exploring the issues we’ve seen, with examples taken from our experiences, and how you can overcome similar challenges as you pursue your own IoT initiatives. Whether you’re a solutions provider building new solutions for clients, or you’re one of the organizations integratingIoT technologiesinto your current systems and processes, I hope this series of posts will equip you with knowledge and strategies that will help you to succeed. If you’re relatively new to IoT and the various technologies and terminologies associated with it, I encourage you first to read theIntro to IoT eBookI wrote. This is a comprehensive (but simple!) introduction to and explanation of many important concepts that I’ll assume readers know as I explore various challenges.I’ll save the in-depth exploration for future posts, but here are just a few of the topics to come: We’re increasingly using sensors and devices to allow us to represent physical objects and their attributes digitally. For example, in asset tracking applications, you’ll likely have a tracker that’s attached to a given asset you’d like to track. The asset is the thing we want to track, but the tracker is the thing that’s capturing and sending data. Therefore, you need to know thatthistracker is onthisasset, which we call“association” or “pairing.” For most asset tracking applications, someone needs to manually associate a tracker to a given asset, and when you introduce a manual step, there are bound to be problems. From labeling issues during manufacturing to operational issues like employees simply not associating trackers to the assets, I’ll share some of the challenges we’ve faced with IoT Association and how you can avoid or overcome them. The Internet of Things is often called “a system of systems,” and with good reason: successful IoT initiatives usually involve a combination of hardware, software, and connectivity, which is then tied into business processes and operations. Because of the complexity and systemic codependence, a simple change in one part of the system — or subsystem — can effectively break the entire system of systems. Let’s say that you want to make some changes to the firmware on your sensor/device to help reduce the battery drain, so you reduce the number of messages sent from the sensor/device per day. Great! You’ve just added on a few months of battery life! But unbeknownst to you, your IoT system uses the number of messages from the sensors/devices to flag when a sensor/device may be defective. After making this change, you suddenly have countless sensors/devices being flagged by the system as defective, which at best hurts user confidence and at worst means that the system itself doesn’t work (e.g.if defective sensors/devices are automatically prevented from being used). Although this challenge effectively boils down to good communication, this can be difficult within a single organization — let alone across the multiple organizations and partnerships that IoT initiatives often require to be successful. In this future post, I’ll share some examples to demonstrate how seriously you should take even the little changes. I’ll also offer some strategies for effectively communicating and managing these changes. I have plenty more topics in mind that I’ll be covering after the above two posts, but this series is ultimately meant to be helpful to you, the reader! So if there’s a particular challenge that you’re facing or that you’d like me to explore, please let me know and I’ll make sure to prioritize it. Just put your thoughts in the“How can we help?” field.

But it should be a busy and exciting year, as key new technologies begin finding their way into real, useful applications. The smartphone will still be our central tech device by the end of next year, but as augmented reality and wearables progress, we’ll sense more and more that a new paradigm in personal computing is around the corner. That will be helped along by enabling technologies such as 5G networks, which will be stretching far and wide by the end of 2020. And, artificial intelligence will become infused in all kinds of products, allowing gadgets and services to subtly begin to anticipate our wants.

https://medium.com/the-looking-glass/innovate-to-elevate-by-thirdy-bon-ozarraga-93c2829dae59?source=tag_archive---------112-----------------------,Innovate to Elevate byThirdy Bon Ozarraga,About the author:,"Shiela Manalo Follow John Clements Lookingglass -- Listen Share Do you ever wonder how successful companies start their thought process in creating products these days? I’ve always been fascinated by how they think and what drives them to create and innovate. How is it that they see things most people do not? What might seem mundane to us could seem profitable to them. What can we learn from how they think and how they see the world? One of the innovators I look up to is Casey Neistat — an American film director, producer, and popular YouTube creator. He said,“If the reason why you’re doing something creative is to make a living, then you are doing it wrong. You get into it because it’s your passion and it’s something that you really believe in.”What I got from this is that the art of innovation starts with the aspiration to make a difference as opposed to profitable gain. Creating purpose means that you can and are changing the world. However, if you do happen to change the world, you would also likely be earning from it. But if it’s the other way around, if you start off with the sole desire to make money, you probably won’t make money — you won’t even change the world. The truth is, you would likely fail. So, determining how you can find meaning and how you can change the world would greatly increase your chances of success. Let’s take a look at some of today’s leading innovators and how their products made a difference — Apple, Google, and YouTube. Apple wanted to make computers accessible — they wanted to bring computing power to everyone; Google wanted to make information available to everyone; and YouTube wanted to enable people to create videos and make it easily available to everyone. These companies started by wanting to make a difference. Today, they are already very successful in their respective fields and are changing the world as we know it. Another lesson we can learn from innovators is the ability to see what others cannot and be the first to jump the curve. Let’s have another look at two successful startups in history — Uber and AirBnb. These companies have revolutionized the fields of transportation and travel by harnessing the power of technology. How? They simply saw the idea of “sharing” and how it could take over their industries like nobody ever did and capitalized on it through the use of available technology. They have challenged traditional industries through the apps they have created and have since reduced customer journey steps, making everything easier and faster. These tech titans, now recognized as “killer companies”, radically changed the game and are now changing the world. It’s a matter of perspective — not getting stuck in a stagnant or comfortable state by being smart and finding better ways. I guess most successful innovators are not waiting for progress; they are a little bit forward-leaning by trying to make progress happen. To create is to innovate and to innovate is to improve what’s already been built. In a time wherein there’s already someone, somewhere who has created what you thought was unique, you have to see things in a different perspective in order to be successful. Have what it takes to be a creator — find an idea and build on it. Once you find your passion for creating, who knows? You could be the next big content creator or CEO of a startup company! Just make sure that you take that first step towards your goal. Please visit and join the John ClementsTalent Community.

Sachin Malhotra Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 5 Listen Share There are no coincidences in this world.— Grand Master Oogway There are no coincidences in this world. — Grand Master Oogway Well, Master Oogway, no disrespect, coincidences do occur and I think they are just God’s way of remaining anonymous. Not just me, Albert Einstein believes this too 😛. 111, that’s not really mylucky number,so to say. However, this number filled me with joy and ecstasy when I saw it as my rank on the rankings page of theLeetCodecontest number 111. What a coincidence! That’s the highest ranking in a weekly contest that I’ve achieved so far on the platform. The contest number and the ranking were obviously pure coincidence. The contest usually consists of an Easy problem, 2 Medium level problems, and a Hard problem. More often than not, the hard problem is something that requires a lot of algorithmic knowledge and prior practice to be able to pull off during the contest. This contest’s final problem was no exception to this. Why do I say it was very hard? Have a look at the number of people who were able to solve it during the contest. As the title of the article suggests, this problem was to be solved using Bit Masking based Dynamic Programming. Dynamic Programmingis one of the most dreaded algorithmic domains out there. It requires a lot of practice to develop intuition about a dynamic programming-based solution to a problem. I’ve always considered it to be an enhancement to a recursive solution to a problem. The main idea behind dynamic programming in layperson’s terms is: Avoid repeated computations by caching the results. Avoid repeated computations by caching the results. Bitmaskingas a topic in computer programming is something that I have (and I’m sure countless of other developers out there have as well) feared for a long time. This is one of those topics that will surely take you off balance in an interview and get you a rejection. Programmers out there generally tend to avoid practicing problems related to this topic simply because it is difficult to build an intuition about it. Optimizations related to bit manipulations occur in the most unexpected of places. With some practice, I have been able to overcome thefear,so to say, of working on bitmasking-based programming problems. In this article, apart from describing the solution to the problem I’ve mentioned above, in detail, I will also go over some basics of bitmasking and some programming problems where it can come in handy. As with any new thing you learn, it’s very difficult to retain theoretical concepts related to bitmasking. Retention is the best when it comes via practice. That is the main aim of this article. Let’s quickly look at the table of contents before we kick off the main article. 0️⃣ 1️⃣ What is Bit Manipulation? 0️⃣ 1️⃣ The Basics ✍️ Counting the Number of set bits Masking and Unmasking a specific bit 🔭 Missing Number 🔭 ☝️🏼✌️🏼 Counting Bits 🖖🏼 🖐🏼 ⛩ Maximum Product of Word Lengths ⛩ Set Representation using Bitmasking 🗄📂Partition Array to K Equal Sum Subsets 📂🗄 🔥 Find the Shortest Superstring 🔥 Conclusion 🍻🍻 References 📝 A bit is to the computing world what an atom is to human life. A bit is to the computing world what an atom is to human life. A bit is essentially the smallest unit of storage in a computer. It’s the only unit that a computer understands. The only information that a bit can store is formed from two different states: 0️⃣ and 1️⃣. Any sort of computation that a computer performs is basically some form of bit manipulation. Let’s look at aWikipediadefinition for bit manipulation: Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Implementation-wise, one of the most useful and effective low-level optimizations to an algorithm is bit manipulation. In some cases, bit manipulation can bypass looping over a data structure and give manifolds speed improvement. The only downfall to such optimizations is the code readability and maintenance. That is one scary piece of ☠code☠ At the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators: And (&) Or (|) Not (~) XOR (^) These are the fundamental operators using which we can perform some complicated bit manipulation operations. Hence, it’s very important to brush up on these operators and their truth tables before moving onto some more interesting stuff. The truth tables show the results for these operators when they operate on 2 bits represented byAandB. The computer has to deal with much more than just one bit of data. The data processed by the system is generally in bytes or kilobytes or more. How do these operators work on operands represented by for e.g. 8-bits or 16-bits? In such a scenario, the operations are the same, except that they operate on each bit of the arguments. Let’s consider a simple example to clarify this. In addition to these 4 basic operators, there are two other set of bitwise operators that do come in very handy. Almost all the problems that we will look at in this article will be making use of them to give a huge boost in computational speed. These are the left shift<<and the right shift>>operators. Simply speaking, the left shift operator means multiplying a number by 2 and the right shift operator means dividing a number by 2. Let’s look at a simple animation to show why these operators are calledleft shiftandright shiftrespectively. For demonstrating the left shift operation, we start off with the decimal number1and then repeatedly multiply it with 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers, the only1in the representation keeps on shifting left one step at a time. That’s why it’s called theleftshiftoperation. Along the same lines, for demonstrating the right shift operation, we start off with the decimal number128and then repeatedly divide it by 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers, the only1in the representation keeps on shifting right one step at a time. That’s why it’s called therightshift operation. Now that we are all versed with the basic binary operators, let’s move on to some simple use cases for these operators. We will look at a few examples below. These are not programming problems by themselves, however, they are used a lot as building blocks in a lot of algorithms. Counting the Number of set bits One of the basic utilities for the operators we looked at above is to count the number of bits, set in a given binary representation. This might not seem an important use case right now, but we will be getting into more details later on and then it will start to seem more meaningful. For now, let’s just count the number of set bits as efficiently as possible. The first method that we will look at for this, is abitintuitive. It makes use of the bitwiseANDoperator. Starting from the least significant bit, we simply check if the bit at each position is set or not and increment a counter accordingly. The AND operator returnsTrueiff both the bits areTrue. Let’s look at the code for this. Yet another way of doing this is byANDingthe number withitself-1until the number becomes zero. The number of steps taken to reach 0 will be the number of set bits in the original number. The reason this works is that every time weANDthe number withitself-1, one bit gets removed from the number. This goes on until the number becomes zero. Masking and Unmasking a specific bit Suppose we want tomask a specificbit in a binary representation.This simply means turning off the bit or transforming a1 → 0. On similar lines,unmaskingsimply means the reverse operation on a specific bit. You might be wondering why this is useful at all. One of the most important use cases for masking (or unmasking) a bit is in set related operations. We can represent a set of items as anX-bitinteger,Xis the number of items in the set. Masking a bit would mean the removal of that item from the set. For a practical application of this, be patient and read on 😛. XOR is a very versatile operator and it is perfect for the task of masking and unmasking operations. XOR outputs 1 when both the bits are opposite and a 0 when both the bits are the same. XOR outputs 1 when both the bits are opposite and a 0 when both the bits are the same. Essentially, we can make use of the samemaskingvariable for achieving the set / un-set operation corresponding to a particular bit (the integer in the ? is being called the masking variable). The above operation will lead to masking the bit at indexiif originally that bit wassetinAand the same operation will lead to unmasking the bit at indexiif originally it wasunsetinA. We have already seen how to detect if a bit is set or not when we looked at ways to count the number of set bits in a given binary representation. An important thing to note here is the index. Usually, for data structures in high-level programming languages, whenever we refer to a specific index, we mean the index of a particular element in that data-structure starting from the left end. What we are referring to an index above is from therightend (the least significant bit in the binary representation has the index 0). That’s more than enough of the basics for now. Let’s get to some actual programming problems. This will help solidify what we’ve learned so far in the article and also help build up an intuition for solving problems using bit manipulation in general. There are multiple ways of solving this problem. We can sort the given list of numbers and then iterate from0..nand easily find the missing number. This will give us aO(NlogN)solution. Another way of solving this problem is by making use of a dictionary. We simply add all the elements in our list to a dictionary and then we can simply search for the missing number. This is a linear time solution but it makes use of additional space. Let’s look at how we can achieve aO(1)space,O(N)time solution like a boss 😎 by using bit manipulation. We will make use theXORproperty here to solve this problem. As mentioned before, XOR evaluates toTruewhen the input bits are different and it evaluates toFalsewhen presented with the same bits. We are interested in the later scenario. What do you think the following evaluates to? XORinga number with itself gives us 0. That’s the main idea behind our approach here. So, what we will do is, we will XOR all the numbers in our list. Let’s call the value we get after this asA. We will XOR all the numbers from0..ntogether. Let’s call this value,B. By doing this, all the numbers present in the original array will get XORed to their counterparts and will evaluate to 0. The only number left in the end will be the missing number. This is one of those problems where writing down the answer for various test cases and observing the results for patterns really helps. So, we will do exactly that and use the pattern we find to directly arrive at the final algorithm. Let’s look at the number of 1’s in the binary representation of the first 16 numbers. The pattern being formed above is the following: An even number, E, has the same number of bits as that of E / 2An odd number, O, has one more bit than that of O / 2 An even number, E, has the same number of bits as that of E / 2An odd number, O, has one more bit than that of O / 2 That’s all there is to see in the results above. This is the algorithm in its entirety. All we have to do is to iterate on numbers from0..nand use the two rules above and we solved the problem like a boss 😎. If you paid attention to the core idea of dynamic programming discussed during the beginning of the article, you’d know that this here, in essence, is a dynamic programming problem. We make use of the result for a previous subproblem (smaller number) to calculate the answer (number of set bits) for the current subproblem. On the face of it, we don’t need any bit manipulation as such to solve this problem. It can be solved by simpleif-elseclauses and aforloop. So, this is notreallya bitmasking + dynamic programming kind of problem. Let’s look at a simple solution based on the ideas above. This is a perfectly good way to solve this problem. For every index,i, we check the number of bits in the numberi / 2and also add1if the current number is odd. We can, however, solve it in a geekier way, so to say using bit manipulation. The two operations being performed are: division by 2 and checking if the number is even or not. We have already seen the use of the right shift operator,>>, for division by 2. As for the second operation, we can simply check if the least significant is set or not. If you notice, all the odd numbers have their least significant bit set. While the even numbers don’t. We have already seen how to check if a particular bit is set or not using theANDoperator. Let’s see a geekier 🤓 version of the above code. If you look at the runtimes for both the programs, they’re almost the same. A major chunk of the time is consumed by the construction of the output array. Bitwise operations are always optimized and are faster than other higher level programming constructs. There’s good news and bad news. The good news is that a slightly optimized version of the brute force algorithm will get your code accepted on the platform. The brute force way is to check all the pairs of words and for each pair, check if there are any common characters between them. For all such pairs that don’t have any common characters, record the maximum value oflen(word1) * len(word2). The bad news is that this algorithm is extremely slow. Let’s look at the percentage of solutions on LeetCode which this brute force algorithm is able to beat. Shame on you, Sachin! That’s not the kind of stats you want to see for your submission. If you’re someone who simply wants tosolvea problem, then your job here is done. Nothing more to do. But, if you’re like me and if you want to make this dog stop 😅, then read on! Let’s look at the time complexity for this brute force algorithm before moving onto a much more optimized solution using bit manipulation. We consider all possible pairs of words from the given array. Considering there areNwords in the given array, we will getO(N²)complexity right off the bat. Other than that, we have a dictionary containing sets of characters for each of the words in the dictionary. Considering the size of the alphabet to be 26 (lowercase alphabets only), each set can potentially be of size26. For each pair of words, we perform a set intersection to check whether the two words have any common characters or not. Set intersection takes linear time and hence, the overall complexity for this algorithm would come out to beO(26N²)which is essentiallyO(N²). It turns out that we can’t get rid of the part where we have to consider each pair of words from the given array. So, we can’t get rid of theO(N²)part of the algorithm. The portion that we can get rid of, however, is the part where we compare two words and see if they have any common characters. That constant26slows down the algorithm a lot. An important thing to note here is that the question simply cares about common characters andnot their frequency or their order. What if we simply use a bitmask to represent the characters in a word? What if we simply use a bitmask to represent the characters in a word? What we can do here is to have a bitmask consisting of 26 bits to represents the characters belonging to a particular word. Let’s look at such a representation for a few words to make things clearer. Hope the above figure makes it clear what we mean by a bitmask representing a corresponding word. Once we have these bitmasks for all the words, all that remains now is to check if two words have any common characters or not. If two words would have any common characters, then the corresponding bits for those characters would be set in the bitmasks for both the words. Hence, all we have to do is to do a bitwiseANDof the bitmasks representing two words and check if we get a 0 or not. If we do end up getting a 0, that would imply no intersection and that is precisely what we are looking for. Let’s look at the code for this modification in the algorithm we just discussed. Bitwise operations are super quick. Let’s look at the performance of this algorithm on the LeetCode platform to corroborate the quickness of bit manipulation. Not bad, right? We improved the runtime for our program from1820 ms earlier to 712 ms now. That’s a huge improvement, isn’t it? It turns out, we can improve this algorithm even further. The improvement can be made because of the fact that two different words can have the same bitmask. The improvement can be made because of the fact that two different words can have the same bitmask. For e.g.helloandllohhelboth would have the same bitmask. We can store thelongest word for a given bitmask since all we care about is maximizing the product of word lengths. Let’s look at the code after incorporating this improvement. By doing this very optimization, the runtime comes down to208ms 🎉🎉🎉 We introduced an idea in the previous problem which will be crucial in the next two problems that we will discuss. Essentially, we used the idea of bitmasking to represent elements belonging to a set. In the previous article, we considered a set of 26 alphabets and we resented that by using a bitmask containing 26 bits. A 0 at a particular index in the mask would represent set exclusion whereas a 1 would represent set inclusion. This idea is very crucial for dynamic programming problems that deal with subproblems involving a subset of numbers. We can’t really cache a subset of numbers. A set is not a hashable data structure. What do we do in such a scenario? This is where we have bitmasks come in. They are memory-efficient ways of representing subsets of elements. Let’s have a look at how we can represent the subsets above using bitmasks. Depending upon the problem’s constraints, we can make use of a bitmask. For e.g. in the previous problem, the alphabet set was limited to the size 26. A lot of programming problems that have small array sizes and involve dynamic programming that require you to hash subsets, usually are an indication of bitmasking-based approach. A 26-bit mask, e.g. in the previous problem, is essentially an integer and we can simply cache that integer in a dictionary. This saves on the memory footprint of the algorithm and greatly cuts down on the time complexity for the algorithm since bit manipulation is very efficient. We can easily include and exclude elements from the subset by masking and unmasking corresponding bits from the mask. Let’s look at another problem based on this idea before we finally discuss the star problem of this article. This is just one of those questions that begs you to use bitmasking. Notice the size of the array. It’s just 16 elements. If we consider a bitmask to represent the elements in an array, we’d have a 16-bit integer at our hands. That means, to represent all the possible subsets of a given array, we’d have 2¹⁶ possible integers. We don’t really needactualsubsets. All we need is a bitmask telling us the elements belonging to that subset. Based on this idea, let’s look at dynamic programming-based approach to solve the above problem. The problem statement only asks us if a k-equal-sum partitioning is possible or not. It doesn’t ask us to return theactualpartitioning. That makes the problem a whole lot simpler. We don’t care which partition an element belongs to as long as the overall sum of a partition is whattotal_sum / k. As we’ve mentioned in the above paragraphs, we will be using a bitmask to represent the elements of the array. We will use the individual bit states of the mask to identify which numbers have already been assigned a partition and which ones still remain to be assigned one. We can only assign a number to a partition if after adding it to that partition, the total sum remains<= total_sum / k. If the sum,S, of all the elements of the array is divisible byk, we have to completek — 1partitions since the last partition will automatically fall into place. In case the total sum is not divisible byk, then such an equal sum partitioning is not possible. Why dynamic programming? Before looking at the code for this problem based on the ideas we’ve discussed above, it’s important to understand how dynamic programming fits into the picture. We’ve already seen why bitmasking would come in handy. But where exactly does dynamic programming fit in? Recursion is a natural fit for the problem since we have got a set ofNelements and we need to partition them intokdifferent subsets all of which have an equal sum. Since we don’t really know what partition a number should belong to, we have to try out all the options. That means, for a given partition, we try adding all available numbers recursively (within the constraints of the partition sum) and see which choice leads us to an answer. The recursion would be based on the following three variables: thenumber of partitionsremaining. themaskrepresenting what elements in the original array areunassigned. and the currentpartition sum. As we all know, for any problem to be classified as a dynamic programming problem, it should have the following two properties: Optimal sub-structure~ which simply means that the original problem must be breakable into subproblems and optimal solutions to the subproblems should be usable in a way to find the optimal solution to the main problem. Overlapping subproblems~ which mean there are multiple recursive calls to the same subproblems and to avoid repeated computations, we cancachethe results for our subproblems. Let’s look at the recursion tree for this problem to understand if we have any overlapping subproblems. We already have the first property satisfied. In the above recursion tree, we consider K = 2. That means we need 2 partitions each of sum18. Since we never reach18in the tree above, theKnever gets reduced. This is just a part of the recursion tree and the complete version. We can clearly see two recursion states getting repeated. We get the same mask0011twice. We can simply store the result once and then re-use it later on. Now let’s look at the code for based on bitmasking + dynamic programming. Now we are finally ready to look at the main problem of this article. The problem that is not as straightforward in its bitmasking application as the current one and the previous one. What do you think the simplest way of forming asuperstringis? You simply take any permutation of the given words and all of these permutations will be valid superstrings. However, the question doesn’t ask us to formanysuperstring. It asks us to form theshortest superstring covering all the words. For this problem, we will explore the idea ofchainingwords together. Intuitively, you can consider the idea of chaining as set union. Let’s consider two different set of elements and then look at the combined set containing all their elements together i.e. the union set. As we can see above, whenever we do a union over two sets, the common elements only appear once. We will adopt a similar idea with chaining two words together. Essentially, when chaining wordsAandBtogether, we will only consider the common portion between thesuffix of A and prefix of B exactly once.Let’s look at the diagrammatic representation for chaining of two words. This is an important concept that will come in handy for solving this problem. So as to avoid repeated computations of finding out thecommon portion between two words which are being chained together,we will do some preprocessing. We will find out the length of the suffix ofAthat overlaps with the prefix ofBwhereA and Bare being chained together. We will do this for all the pairs of words in our given list. In Python, given a stringS, we can make use ofS[i:]to obtain all the suffixes andS[:i]to obtain all the prefixes. We make use of this for our preprocessing below. Now that the idea of chaining is clear, we can move onto the next part of the problem where we explain why this problem can be solved recursively. Why Recursion? Now that we are familiar with the concept of chaining, we know that whenever we chain two words together, the new word formed can be shorter than the combined lengths of the two original words. Extending this idea to all the words in the given list, we have to form a superstring that will be formed by chaining one word after the other until we are done with all the words. The important question here is, in what order should the words be chained together? For the three wordsaabc,hjaa, andchujthe chaining orderhjaa → aabc → chuj = hjaabchujis better thanaabc → hjaa → chuj = aabchjaachujsince the former gives a superstring of length 9 as opposed to 12 in the latter order. So, the chaining order determines the overall length of the formed superstring. We will betrying out all possible arrangementsfor the superstrings using the given list of words and choosing the shortest one. We will betrying out all possible arrangementsfor the superstrings using the given list of words and choosing the shortest one. That seems legit, but why dynamic programming? 🤔 Instead of relying on a recursion tree for explaining the need for dynamic programming, we will look at an example that will explain the same idea. Suppose we are given a set of 5 words[A, B, C, D, E]and we are to form the shortest superstring that contains all the words. We already know that we are solving this problem recursively. Suppose in the middle of our recursion, we are already done deciding the chaining order of the first 3 words. Let’s say this ordering wasB → A → C. Now, we need to find out the best way to chainD and E after C so that the overall superstring length is minimized. Let’s say that in our recursion we found thatC → E → Dwas the best chaining order. We don’t know yet if the superstring formed viaB → A → C → E → Dis the shortest one. However, we know thatC → E → Dis the best chaining order for the three wordsC, D, and E. Suppose now we arranged the first three words a little differently in our recursion (a separate recursion path) and now we haveA → B → Cand we have to recurseagainto find out the best possible arrangement forE and D. However, we already know from above the best possible arrangement isC → E → D. Why calculate this again? This is where dynamic programming comes into the picture. That’s it? Go on. Explain some more. Nah, let’s now look at the the Python code bringing all these ideas together. Uh oh! Where the heck is bitmasking in all this? Ok ok, let’s get to bitmasking 🎉 Let’s rephrase the problem in a slightly different manner that will make the requirement for bitmasking very clear. Given a set ofNelements, we need to find a suitable arrangement for them that will minimize a certain metric. Since we are relying on dynamic programming, we will becachingresults for subproblems. Our subproblems will be represented by the subset of these N items. As we’ve seen in this article and especially in the previous two problems, it’s difficult to cache subsets as it is. In case the problem constraints are small, we can represent the elements of the list using a bitmask and use that for caching purposes. After all, a bitmask is just a number. After all, a bitmask is just a number. Let’s finally get to the code for finding the shortest superstring given a set of N words. Line 3 ~The initial mask is composed of all 1s. That implies all the words are available for chaining. If the mask becomes 0, that means no word is left for chaining. So, the length of the superstring would be 0. This is the base case. Line 7 ~If you’ve paid attention to the example involving 5 words[A, B, C, D, E]from before, you know that the opportunity of caching arises when we have the two wordsD and Eto be chained togetherfollowing C.Thus, we need to know the previous word in the superstring so far so as to attach the rest of the words. Hence,prev_i, which represents the index in the original array of the previous word in the superstring is also used for caching purposes apart from the mask. Line 12, 15 ~We always check all the given set of words and only consider those asoptions for the current step in our recursionwhich have not been previously used. We make use of bitmasking for this. To see if a word has been used or not, we simply check if the bit at the corresponding index in the mask isunsetor not. Line 18 ~Makes use of the preprocessing we did earlier. For the word to be chained / attached to the word at indexprev_i, we know the amount of overlap between the two. Thus, if we decide on considering the word at indexias the next word in our recursion, the amount of length it will add to our superstring would belen(A[i]) — overlap between the words A[prev_i] and A[i] All this is fine and dandy, but wasn’t the original question asking for the superstring itself and not just the length of the shortest superstring? Am I shying away from solving the entire problem? Of course not! The functionrecursesimply returns thelengthof the shortest superstring and not the superstring itself. The problem statement, however, asks us to find out the shortest superstring. If you look at the code carefully, you’ll notice aparentdictionary. At every step in our recursion, we have multiple options of words which can be chained to the current superstring (thus extending it). We use the parent dictionary to store the word at each step that gave thebestanswer (shortest length). For a given mask — which tells us which words have already been chained together — and a given previous word (prev_i), theparentdictionary stores the next word that in the superstring that gives the optimal answer. We will use this dictionary to backtrack and form theshortest superstring. In the end, that’s one of the best sights for a competitive programmer, especially if it’s for a hard problem in a timed competition. Operations on bits are highly efficient and they are generally performed in parallel via optimized system level instructions. It’s difficult, but not impossible, to write clean, understandable code involving bit manipulations. AND,OR, andNOTare the three fundamental bitwise operators. Theleft-shift <<and theright-shift >>operators are used for multiplication or division by 2. TheXORoperator is a versatile operator that can be used in many different programming problems. It returnsTrueonly when both the bits are opposites andFalseotherwise. Dynamic Programming-based solutions involve some sort of caching for the results of subproblems. The subproblems are represented by a set of variables. These variables are not necessarily primitive data types. Bitmasking comes in very handy in dynamic programming problems when we have to deal with subsets and the list/array size is small. A mask (having all 0s or all 1s) can represent the elements of the set and setting or unsetting a bit can mean inclusion and exclusion from the set. If the array/list/set size is, say, around 20, then you’d have 2²⁰possiblebitmasks which comes out to be almost a million of them. It’s not always the case you will encounterallof these bitmasks in a test case. However, that’s the maximum possible number. We have to be careful about when to use bitmasking. We can’t have a 100-bit mask as that would be computationally intractable. For a solution to be eligible for dynamic programming, it should satisfy the optimal substructure and the overlapping subproblems properties. Usually, through some practice, you can start to identify if the problem at hand will have a DP based solution or not. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/bit-manipulation/ https://blog.bitsrc.io/bitmask-there-is-space-at-the-bottom-5a741d18c4e3 https://bit.ly/2QRTIpj https://bit.ly/2CCUCxn https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitmasking-and-dynamic-programming-set-1-count-ways-to-assign-unique-cap-to-every-person/ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitmasking-dynamic-programming-set-2-tsp/ https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/17973 It’s been a long article and one that I’ve absolutely loved writing.

DApp이 비즈니스 로직을 업데이트할 수 있다는 점, 두 가지 이유를 통해 스마트 컨트랙트의 ‘Upgradeability(업그레이드 가능성)’의 필요성에 대해논의한 후, Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework가 만족시켜야 할 조건들과 Storage, Function Call 그리고 DelegateCall의배경지식을 살펴보았습니다. 이후, Proxy와 Registry를 이용한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework를설명했습니다. Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework(이하 USCF)을 이용하면, Atomic한 업그레이드와 동일한 Entry point를 통해 DApp 서비스의 질을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 하지만 여전히 서비스 운영에 있어 개발자의 어려움이 남아 있습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 서비스를 운영하기 위해서는 개발자가 USCF에 대한 모든 배경 지식을 알고 있어야 한다는 점입니다. 실제 서비스는 여러 컨트랙트들로 이루어져 있는 경우가 대부분이기 때문에 모든 컨트랙트들과 각 컨트랙트들에 해당하는 Proxy 컨트랙트들을 일일이 관리해야 하며, 배포 단계에서 배포와 업그레이드 함수 호출의 순서를 알고 있어야 합니다. 이러한 프레임워크에 대한 배경지식들은 진입 장벽이 되어 개발 속도를 현저히 떨어뜨립니다. 그렇다면 기존에 존재하던 여러 프레임워크들은 어떤 방식을 취하고 있을까요? 프레임워크는 그들만의 도구가 존재합니다. 가깝게는 스마트 컨트랙트 테스트시 사용하는Truffle Framework를 살펴볼 수 있습니다. Truffle Framework는 자바스크립트 테스트 도구인mocha를 사용하여 스마트 컨트랙트 테스팅 방법론을 제시합니다. 기존에 많이 쓰이는 mocha의 형태를 따라가기 때문에 직관적인 장점이 있지만, 스마트 컨트랙트를 테스팅 하기 위해서는 여러 전처리 작업이 필요합니다. 컴파일, 배포, 블록체인과 연결, 주소 저장 등의 작업은 필수적이지만 매 테스트 시 설정하기에는 상당히 번거롭습니다. 이를 위해, Truffle Framework는truffle cli tool를 함께 제공하여 전처리 작업을 자동화합니다. 사실상 이 도구가 없으면 이 Framework를 사용하기에 많은 제약이 있다고 할 수 있습니다. 프론트엔드 개발자들에게 친숙한React역시 그를 위한 도구가 있습니다. React는 프론트엔드에서 UI(User Interface)를 만들기 위한 자바스크립트 프레임워크 중 하나입니다. 효과적인 환경을 제공하기에 최근 많은 인기를 얻고 있지만 React를 사용하기 위해 필요한 환경설정은 상당히 복잡합니다. 많은 라이브러리들이 필요하며, 독자적인 설정 파일과 파일 구조를 가지고 있어, 수동으로 설정하기에는 시간이 꽤 소요됩니다. 이를 위해, 이러한 개발 환경을 자동으로 만들어주는create-react-app이란 도구가 존재합니다. create-react-app에서는 명령어 한줄로 즉시 개발과 테스팅이 가능한 환경을 만들어주기 때문에 개발자가 React 프레임워크에 빠르게 적응하게 도와줍니다. 이처럼, 개발자에게 하여금 많은 학습시간을 필요로 하는 프레임워크에는 이들을 쉽게 사용하게끔 도와주는 도구가 대부분 존재합니다. USCF도 앞선 포스팅에서 설명드린 배경지식 없이는 이용하기 어렵습니다. HAECHI LABS는 이러한 지식 없이도 손쉽게 업그레이드 가능한 스마트 컨트랙트를 구현하고 배포하기 위해vvisp이라는 툴을 개발하였습니다. vvisp은 아래와 같은 배경지식이 없어도 쉽게 이용할 수 있습니다. Proxy와 Registry Contract에 대한 이해 업그레이드 함수 호출에 대한 이해 배포 및 function call 순서에 대한 이해 위와 같은 이해가 부족한 상태에서 vvisp 없이 개발을 한다면 컨트랙트를 잘못 작성하거나, 함수 호출 순서를 잘못 부르거나, 잘못된 인자를 넘겨주는 등 실수할 여지가 많습니다. 경제적 가치를 지니는 암호화폐가 유통되는 DApp이라면 이러한 실수가 치명적인 결과를 초래할 수도 있습니다. 따라서 vvisp은 개발자가 USCF에 대한 이해가 부족하더라도 실수하지 않고 편하고 빠르게 배포할 수 있도록 돕습니다. vvisp이 제공하는 기능은 다음과 같습니다. Proxy와 Registry solidity 컨트랙트를 library로 제공Open Source 컨트랙트인 Proxy 컨트랙트와 Registry 컨트랙트를 vvisp에 탑재하였습니다. 개발자는 제공된 라이브러리를 사용하여 이 두 컨트랙트 개발에 대한 고민 없이 비즈니스 로직에 대한 컨트랙트만 개발할 수 있습니다. 여러 함수 호출 및 배포 순서 자동화USCF에서 가장 까다로운 부분이 바로 실제 배포 단계입니다. 도구 없이 배포하기 위해서는 다음과 같은 까다로운 절차가 필요합니다.- Registry 컨트랙트 배포- Business 컨트랙트와 그에 대응하는 Proxy 컨트랙트를 배포- Business 컨트랙트와 Proxy 컨트랙트를 Registry를 통해 atomic하게 연결vvisp은 이러한 배포 절차를 자동화하여 개발자의 고충을 해결합니다. 명령어 한 줄을 통한 서비스 배포 실행‘사용이 쉽다’라는 전제를 만족하기 위해 가장 중요하게 생각한 요소입니다. vvisp은 위의 배포 과정을$vvisp deploy-service한 줄을 통해 모든 작업을 자동 실행하여 수작업을 통한 실수를 제거합니다. 이제,샘플 앱을 통해 이 작업이 어떻게 이루어지는지 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. 간단한 DApp 프로젝트를 위해 새로운 디렉토리를 하나 생성합니다. 해당 디렉토리에서 프로젝트를 시작하기 위해 vvisp을 설치합니다. 혹은 이제 생성한 디렉토리에서 샘플 DApp 프로젝트를 시작합니다. 해당 안내와 함께 프로젝트를 위한 환경이 만들어집니다. 컨트랙트 테스트를 위한 truffle의 디렉토리 구조를 지원하여 보다 손쉽게 두 도구를 모두 이용할 수 있습니다. 또한, HAECHI LABS에서 코드 감사를 위해 사용하는 스크립트와 여러 유용한 라이브러리가 함께 있어 프로젝트 bootstrapping을 빠르게 할 수 있습니다. 이제 해당 디렉토리의contracts/폴더 내에서 샘플 DApp 컨트랙트를 생성합니다. 해당 DApp은 크게 두 가지 컨트랙트로 이루어져 있습니다. 사용자는 Haechi라는 가상의 펫을 키울 수 있습니다.HaechiV1컨트랙트에서는 Haechi의 소유권과 각 Haechi의 능력치에 대해 구현되어 있습니다. 가상의 달리기 시합을 한다고 할때, 사용자는HaechiV1.sol의run함수를 불러 Haechi를 달리게 할 수 있습니다. 이때, Haechi의 빠르기velocity는 Haechi의 고유 능력치이며, 이를HaechiGym.sol에서 ‘강화’할 수 있습니다. 간단한 DApp이지만 이를 업그레이드 가능하도록 배포하기 위해서는 앞서 이야기한 장벽이 존재합니다. 이제 vvisp을 통해 이를 어떻게 단순화하였는지 살펴보겠습니다. 배포에 앞서 vvisp 프로젝트는 사용할 네트워크와 계정의 설정이 필요합니다. 생성된 프로젝트 내의.env파일에서 몇 가지 환경 변수를 설정합니다. NETWORK: 연결하고자 하는 네트워크의 이름입니다.local을 제외하고, vvisp은infura를 지원합니다. PORT:local선택시, 연결하고자 하는 포트 번호입니다. INFURA_API_KEY: 외부 네트워크 연결시 필요한 infura api key입니다. MNEMONIC: 트랜잭션을 생성할 대상의 mnemonic key입니다. PRIV_INDEX:MNEMONIC으로 생성될 private key의 index입니다. 기본 값은 0입니다. GAS_PRICE: 트랜잭션 발생시 설정하고자 하는 gas price입니다. 기본값은10Gwei이며, 입력 단위는wei입니다. 현재 입력된 정보는local:8545에 연결된 노드에서MNEMONIC의 첫 번째 계좌로부터10Gwei로 트랜잭션을 발생시키겠다는 뜻입니다. 해당.env파일의 작성이 끝나면 이제 본격적인 배포를 시작합니다. * 기본적으로 vvisp의 컨셉은Terraform을 참고하였습니다. 참고: 기존에 클라우드 인프라(AWS 등)를 수동으로 배포할 경우, 설정 등 일관성이 깨져 매번 다른 인프라가 배포될 수 있습니다. Terraform과 같은 IaaC(Infrastructure as a Code) 툴은 인프라 배포 과정을 코드로 일관성과 가독성 있게 관리하는 데 도움을 주는 도구입니다. Terraform은 인프라 배포를 위한 설정 파일을 작성하게 하여 일관성과 가독성을 제공합니다. 참고: 기존에 클라우드 인프라(AWS 등)를 수동으로 배포할 경우, 설정 등 일관성이 깨져 매번 다른 인프라가 배포될 수 있습니다.

Terraform과 비슷하게 vvisp 역시 서비스 배포를 위해서는 컨트랙트들의 정보를 기록한 배포 설정 파일,service.vvisp.json이 필요합니다. 이 파일에 배포 정보를 어떻게 기록하는지 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. serviceName: 배포하고자 하는 서비스의 이름입니다. variables: 이 파일에서 사용할 constant 변수를 지정합니다. 현재 기입된 owner의 주소는${variables.owner}로 접근 가능합니다. contracts: 이번 버전 서비스를 구성하는 contract들의 정보를 적는 곳입니다. contracts/contractName: 컨트랙트의 key 값입니다. 실제 컨트랙트 명 또는 파일 명이 아닌 별도의 추상적인 이름으로 버전을 관리할 수 있습니다.

DApp의 첫 배포가 끝나면 자동으로state.vvisp.json이 생성됩니다. state.vvisp.json은 배포된 서비스와 이를 구성하는 컨트랙트들의 정보를 보여주는 파일입니다. 다음과 같은 항목이 기입됩니다. serviceName: 배포된 서비스 명 registry: Registry 컨트랙트의 주소 contracts: 현재 배포된 버전을 구성하는 컨트랙트 종류 contracts/contractName:service.vvisp.json에서 정의된 컨트랙트의 key 값 contracts/contractName/upgradeable: 업그레이드 가능한지 여부 표현 contracts/contractName/address: Business 컨트랙트의 주소 contracts/contractName/fileName: 배포한 Business 컨트랙트의 파일(컨트랙트) 명 contracts/contractName/proxy: 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트의 Proxy 컨트랙트 주소(업그레이드가 불가능한 컨트랙트는 해당 항목이 존재하지 않음) 해당 파일에 기록되는 정보는 Registry 컨트랙트에도 저장되어 있기 때문에, 만약state.vvisp.json파일이 변경/삭제되어도 Registry 컨트랙트에 기록된 정보를 토대로 언제든 복구가 가능합니다. (추후 Registry 컨트랙트를 바탕으로 자동으로state.vvisp.json을 복구하는 기능 또한 추가할 예정입니다.) 이제 앞서 생성한 샘플 DApp을 vvsip으로 업그레이드하는 과정을 살펴보겠습니다. HaechiV1에서 Haechi는 달리기를 할 수 있었다면, 이제 날 수 있도록 업그레이드하려고 합니다. 개발자는 다음과 같은 두 가지 절차를 따릅니다. 1. 이전 버전 컨트랙트인HaechiV1.sol을 상속받은HaechiV2.sol을 생성한 후 변경할 로직을 작성 2. 배포 설정 파일state.vvisp.json의contracts/Haechi를 다음과 같이 변경 파일명을 변경 initialize항목을 삭제(HaechiV2.sol컨트랙트는 initialize 하지 않음) 위 과정에서 개발자는 변경할 비즈니스 로직과 배포 정보 이외에는 신경쓰지 않아도 되며 간단하게 업그레이드를 준비할 수 있습니다. 이제$vvisp deploy-service를 통해 다음 버전으로 서비스를 업그레이드 합니다. 배포가 끝나면 변경사항이state.vvisp.json에 저장됩니다. 업그레이드를 실행했던Haechi의fileName과address가 바뀐 것을 알 수 있습니다. Proxy 컨트랙트의 주소는 바뀌지 않았기 때문에 서비스는 유저에게 동일한 Entry point를 제공할 수 있습니다. 앞에서는 언급되지 않았지만 vvisp의deploy-service에는 몇 가지 주요 기능들이 더 있습니다. Cyclic Dependency 스마트 컨트랙트의 생성자에 다른 컨트랙트의 address를 인자로 넘겨주는 것은 흔한 패턴입니다. 특히, 여러 컨트랙트가 얽혀 있는 DApp의 경우, 한 컨트랙트가 많은 컨트랙트의 주소를 참조하고 있을 수 있습니다. 위 코드는ContractA가ContractB의 address를 생성자에서 참조하고 있는 코드입니다. 이 때 컨트랙트가 배포되기 전까진 해당 컨트랙트의 주소를 알 수 없습니다. 따라서ContractB가ContractA보다 먼저 배포되어야 합니다. 그런데 아래와 같이ContractB도 반대로ContractA를 참조하고 있다면, 즉 서로가 서로를 참조하고 있다면, 컨트랙트 배포 순서를 정할 수 없게 됩니다. 따라서 두 컨트랙트를 모두 배포할 때, 먼저 배포되는 컨트랙트에는 올바른 인자를 전달할 수 없습니다. 이를 Cyclic Dependency가 존재하는 상황이라고 합니다. 컨트랙트 수가 3개라면, A가 B를, B가 C를, C가 A를 참조하게 될 경우 Cyclic Dependency가 형성됩니다. 이는 사실상 잘못된 설계이며 올바른 배포가 일어나지 않습니다. 따라서, vvisp은 배포 전 이를 자동으로 확인하는 과정을 거치며, 만약 Cyclic Dependency가 존재할 경우 배포를 시작하지 않습니다. Cyclic Dependency가 발견되지 않는다면, vvisp은 컨트랙트들 간의 dependency 순서도(DAG)를 만들고 그 순서대로 자동 배포하여 컨트랙트의 주소를 올바르게 전달합니다. 참고: 위 사항은 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트에 대해서는 적용되지 않습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트는 미리 모든 컨트랙트들을 배포한 후 연결 작업만 시행하기 때문에, 주소가 모두 공개되어 있어 Cyclic Dependency를 고려하지 않아도 됩니다. 참고: 위 사항은 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트에 대해서는 적용되지 않습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트는 미리 모든 컨트랙트들을 배포한 후 연결 작업만 시행하기 때문에, 주소가 모두 공개되어 있어 Cyclic Dependency를 고려하지 않아도 됩니다. Deployment Resuming vvisp이 DApp 서비스를 배포할 때에는 여러 트랜잭션을 순서대로 발생하게 됩니다. 이 때, 갑작스럽게 네트워크/노드에 장애가 일어나거나 다른 클라이언트에서 같은 주소로 동시에 트랜잭션을 날려 nonce가 겹치는 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 배포를 진행중이던 vvisp은 작업을 중단하게 됩니다. 생각보다 이러한 문제는 자주 발생합니다. 그런데 이 때마다 처음부터 다시 배포한다면 시간도 오래 소요될 뿐더러 많은 양의 가스를 소모하게 됩니다. 따라서 도중에 배포가 중단되었다면 중단된 곳부터 다시 재시작하는 기능이 꼭 필요합니다. 재시작을 위해서는 중단된 시점과 중간 상태에 대한 정보가 필요합니다. 즉, 서비스의 현 상태에 대해 저장된 정보가 필요합니다. vvisp에서는 이를 간단한 State Machine을 도입하여 구현하였습니다. $vvisp deploy-service는 아래 순서대로 트랜잭션을 발생시킵니다. Deploy Registry: 서비스가 처음 배포된다면 Registry 컨트랙트를 배포합니다. Deploy Business Contracts: 업그레이드 가능하도록 정의된 컨트랙트들의 Business 컨트랙트를 배포합니다. Deploy Proxy Contracts: 업그레이드 가능하도록 정의된 컨트랙트들의 Proxy 컨트랙트를 배포합니다. Deploy Non-Upgradeable Contracts: 업그레이드 불가능하도록 정의된 컨트랙트들을 배포합니다. Upgrade: 업그레이드 가능하도록 정의된 컨트랙트들의 Business 컨트랙트, Proxy 컨트랙트를 Registry 컨트랙트와 연결합니다. 만약 배포 도중 어떤 문제상황이 발생하여 배포가 중단되었다면 아래와 같은 메시지를 출력합니다. 이 때, 중간 상태에 대한 정보가state.vvisp.json에 기록됩니다. 이는 Token 컨트랙트의 Proxy 컨트랙트를 배포하던 중 중단되었다는 뜻으로, 해당 정보 이외에도 많은 중간 상태들이 파일에 기록되어 있습니다. 이 때, 안내된 메시지와 같이$vvisp deploy-service를 재입력하면 중단되었던 곳부터 배포를 재시작할 수 있습니다. Registry 컨트랙트 내의 배포 정보 state.vvisp.json을 통해 배포 정보를 보여주는 것은 가시적이며 간단합니다. 그러나 불가변성이라는 장점을 지닌 블록체인을 두고 local file에만 의존하는 것은 중요한 기능을 놓치고 있는 것이라 생각합니다. 그래서 배포된 contract의 정보들(file 이름 등)을 Registry 컨트랙트에 쓰는 형태를 택하여,state.vvisp.json뿐만 아니라 Registry 컨트랙트 내에도 모든 정보를 보관할 수 있도록 하였습니다. 현재 버전(v0.1.9)의 vvisp에서는 Registry에 기록을 저장하는 기능까지만 구현되어 있습니다. 추후에는 배포 전 Registry 컨트랙트의 정보를 읽어 현재 local file(state.vvisp.json)이 최신인지 여부를 판단하는 기능과 해당 정보를 통해state.vvisp.json을 복구하는 기능도 추가할 예정입니다. 지금까지 vvisp의 메인 기능인deploy-service에 대해 살펴보았습니다. 이외에도 vvisp은 스마트 컨트랙트 개발을 도와주는 다양한 기능들을 지원하고 있습니다. 자세한 사항은 아래 vvisp github을 참고하시기 바랍니다. :) HAECHI-LABS/vvisp Command Line Interface for the Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework. - HAECHI-LABS/vvisp github.com Facebook을 비롯한 오늘날의 서비스들은 한 달에도 서너 번의 업데이트를 진행하며 서비스의 품질을 향상시키고 있습니다. 만약, 어떠한 서비스가 업그레이드를 하지 않아 시장의 변화와 이용자의 니즈를 반영하지 못한다면 그 서비스는 도태되고 말 것입니다. 스마트 컨트랙트를 이용한 DApp 서비스도 예외는 아닙니다. 그러나 스마트 컨트랙트 위에서 Upgradeability를 구현하기란 쉽지 않습니다. 앞서 언급드린 Proxy와 Registry의 개념, 스마트 컨트랙트의 storage 구조 등을 모두 이해하고 있어야 하며 업그레이드를 어떻게 진행해야하는지에 대한 과정 역시 개발자가 숙지하고 있어야 합니다. HAECHI LABS에서 개발한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework(vvisp)은 이러한 작업을 간소화하였습니다. 필요한 컨트랙트 라이브러리를 지원하고, 단 한 줄의 명령어로 배포를 자동 실행해주어 개발자가 실제 서비스에 필요한 Business 로직 개발에만 집중할 수 있는 환경을 제공하고 있습니다. HAECHI LABS는 블록체인이 정말 세상을 바꿀 만한 기술임을 입증하기 위해서는 훌륭한 적용 사례가 등장해야 한다고 믿습니다. 또한 이를 위해서, 많은 개발자/회사들이 쉽고 편리하게 블록체인 서비스를 만들 수 있어야 한다고 생각합니다. HAECHI LABS는 누구나 손쉽게 블록체인 위에 서비스를 개발할 수 있는 세상을 만든다는 비전을 위해 나아가고 있으며, vvisp은 이러한 발걸음 중 하나입니다. 앞으로 vvisp은 많은 기능들이 추가되어 발전될 예정입니다! 해당 오픈 소스 프로젝트가 더 많은 사람들이 다양한 서비스를 만드는 데에 작은 도움이 되었으면 좋겠습니다. 또한 오픈 소스를 더 발전시키기 위해 여러 개발자 분들과 함께 이야기하고 싶습니다. 관심있으신 분들은 언제든지 편하게 vvisp 오픈 소스 프로젝트에 합류해주세요! :) HAECHI LABS는 언제나 함께 세상을 바꾸어 갈 분들을 향해 문을 활짝 열어두고 있습니다.채용에 관련된 자세한 사항은여기를 참고해주세요.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/netflix-pulls-subscriptions-from-ios-bypassing-apple-tax-5b253b8337f1?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,Netflix Pulls Subscriptions from iOS Bypassing Apple Tax,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Glen Whillier Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share In early 2018 Netflix pulled the option to subscribe to their service through the Google Play store in order to bypass the share that Google takes of subscriptions. The decision left many assuming that the same fate would await their iOS app and indeed as 2018 ended so to did the option of subscribing to Netflix through the Apple App Store. “We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members,” a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. “We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members,” a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. This comes after many developers have voiced their upset over the percentage both Apple and Google take of any in-app purchase. Both companies used to take 30% but in more recent years cut that figure to 15%. Still tensions have remained high between developers and the two tech giants. Netflix isn’t the first company to do this, it’s one of many. Spotify pulled the option to subscribe in-app on iOS. Amazon limits movie and tv-show rentals through Prime Video to its website; Purchasing Kindle books isn’t available through their Kindle app either. Epic Games opted to release Fortnite on Android purposely not on the Google Play store to avoid Google taking a cut on in-game purchases. So just how much are companies like Apple and Google profiting off of these subscriptions? Netflix on iOS was grossing approximately $2.4 million a day in 2018, Apple’s cut would be around $700,000 of that figure. According to Sensor Tower, to date Netflix has generated $1.5 billion in in-app subscriptions, meaning Apple took home a comfortable $450 million+. It’s not entirely surprising why these companies are opting for the less user-friendly options and it also makes you wonder whether any other apps on the top-grossing list will consider making the jump.

https://medium.com/smartsheet-news/invest-less-to-innovate-more-26726e2ba839?source=tag_archive---------94-----------------------,Invest Less to Innovate More,Published inSmartsheet News,"Mark Mader Follow Smartsheet News -- Listen Share Generating ideas from insights that improve a business, or create value for its customers, might be the most important thing your business does. Such innovation makes an organization more competitive and more efficient, often translating to more success and bigger profits, or in other cases — survival. Investing in those ideas comes at a cost, of course, including the risk that failure could leave you in a worse position than had you done nothing at all. Fortunately, advances in technology aimed at empowering business users have fundamentally redefined what’s achievable and, at the same time, has improved the probability weighted outcomes of business improvement initiatives. As a result, the assumptions that business leaders have traditionally used to calculate the costs of innovation — whether “back-of-the-napkin” or comprehensive models — are no longer valid. In fact, I contend that the “risk” of innovation has never been lower. When business leaders have evaluated “innovation” opportunities for things such as process improvement, deeper customer engagement, or enhanced decisioning, they’ve generally considered six factors: Potential benefits, financial or otherwise Financial capital required to fund project Human capital required to deliver project Opportunity cost of pursuit Time required to realize benefit Risk of partial realization or outright failure But by reducing three key factors — cost, time, and resources required — business user driven work management technologies can also minimize the risk of outright failure. That means business leaders should recalibrate their assumptions about technology-based investment decisions, by increasing the probability of success. Higher probabilities combined with higher throughput of projects executed upon, can result in superior overall returns. Technology unleashes the power of innovation The driver is the ongoing infusion of technology tools, which has reduced real and perceived costs which were previously assumed to be too high to justify an initiative or process improvement. These tools include a range of work execution applications and services, and the automation and integration of work processes that wasn’t easily attainable just a few years ago. Those technologies make many ideas and innovations feasible without the costs traditionally associated with calling in scores of consultants or trying to climb up the consideration list of heavily taxed IT departments. This enables waves of new experimentation — more quickly and with less risk. Projects that used to take years or months to mobilize, can now take months or weeks, including change management and training — a big win from the absolute standpoint of time savings, but an even bigger win in a relative sense. In addition, powerful new “no-code” software allows business users — those closest to the opportunities for innovation — to deploy and configure systems themselves, with minimal dependence on technical resources. That allows companies to maximize their innovation “at bats” by investing in more ideas that come from employees at all levels and across all divisions of their organization. Empowering a broad range of knowledge workers to engage with their work in a richer, deeper, more meaningful way — and thereby transform their great ideas into innovative action —willfeel like uncharted territory to leadership teams not accustomed to seeing business teams applying advanced technology. Embrace the benefits: unleashing the opportunity for innovation across an organization will lead to more base hits. I’ve watched as many business-driven innovations have, together, made a significant and positive impact on the business I lead and the people with whom I work. While all those base hits are great, technology is also helping drive more home runs than ever. Knowledge workers, empowered with tools to pursue more ideas at lower cost, can increasingly swing for the fences. And the innovative new companies they work for are increasingly rising up to challenge established businesses and even entire industries. Consider Uber, for example. Less than 10 years after its founding, it has disrupted taxi services in hundreds of cities worldwide. The company’s reported recent confidential filing for an initial public offering could give it a stunning valuation of as much as $120 billion. That’s more than the entire U.S. auto industry. Meanwhile, the price of a New York City taxi medallion has plunged from about $1 million in 2013, to about $200,000 today. And that actually demonstrates a new kind of risk — the risk ofnotfacilitating innovation at all levels and missing out on new opportunities. The fact is that technology is lowering barriers for everyone. That means not just your current competition, but also companies that don’t even exist yet. And that’s what makes a company like Gillette vulnerable to Dollar Shave Club, and established cable providers vulnerable to Netflix. New technology isn’t always a zero-sum game, with winners driving losers out of business. Sometimes it creates entire new industries and opportunities, like digital home security systems, wearable tech like the Apple Watch, or digital assistants from Amazon, Google and others. Many of those opportunities haven’t even been identified yet. But we can say who will take advantage of them. It will be the more agile companies that empower their employees to innovate and iterate at a rapid pace.It will be the companies that continually adopt new technologies and experiment with them, with an eye toward creating value, not protecting it. Reconsidering the cost calculus and the evolving nature of risk are essential for businesses to find the best way forward in the era of disruptive technology. Every business leader, IT decision maker, and knowledge worker needs to recalibrate their assumptions about the costs and risks of business innovation.",Mark Mader,https://medium.com/@markmader?source=post_page---byline--26726e2ba839---------------------------------------,14,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*wRltBaF4G57WTC0A.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Rlg4xeOwB_Q4kWyvMc5Z3Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Rlg4xeOwB_Q4kWyvMc5Z3Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Rlg4xeOwB_Q4kWyvMc5Z3Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*wRltBaF4G57WTC0A.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*wRltBaF4G57WTC0A.jpg,2019-01-02T19:06:21.126Z,Medium

Tim Leberecht Follow Predict -- Listen Share When I read about the tech trend predictions for 2019, I feel a strong sense of déjà vu. So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity, and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers, personalize their experience, and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking,” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture, is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level, including achieving immortality. Sound familiar? This future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously, the future is not just unevenly distributed, it is also taking a really long time to arrive. Incrementalism is the new disruption, and pragmatism the new moonshot. In this spirit, here are three tech trends that are not groundbreaking but may make or break your business in 2019. If you aren’t yet, this will be the year in which you ought to become exponential-tech-literate. Here’s the new ABC that you must master: A for “AI goes enterprise” By 2030,AI is projected to generate an estimated $13 trillion of GDP growth. In 2019, AI is going to penetrate the enterprise as an indispensable, mission-critical capability. The question is no longer, what tasks do you perform with AI but which tasks do younot? Supporting this line of thinking, a recently published research report by the MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) claims that AI is “becoming real”– advanced by a cohort of Fortune 500 firms beyond the usual AI-alphas Alphabet, Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft. While many firms have dipped their toes in AI and recognized it as a key strategic challenge, only a few have actually devised, let alone implemented, a comprehensive AI strategy. Among them are Chevron, Mayo Clinic, and Pfizer. Identified as “pioneers” by the study, these firms were early adopters of AI, and they are now doubling down on their investment and seeking to scale it beyond sporadic pilots and point solutions. Ninety percent of these pioneers report they have a strategy in place already. What’s even more interesting is that 72 percent of them expect AI applications to primarily deliver revenue increases in the next five years, as opposed to mere efficiency gains. This means that AI will no longer be limited to just optimizing operations but is driving entire new business models. Emulating these pioneers, it might be time for you, too, to “become real” about AI by moving beyond process optimization. Armed with growing AI acumen, ask yourself: how would you radically re-design your business model from scratch today? Andrew Ng, the Chairman and CEO of Landing AI and former head of the Google Brain team and the Baidu AI Group, provides some helpful guidance in his newAI Transformation Playbook. He suggests forming an internal AI team that spans different business functions. Further, he advises companies to diversify their AI investment by creating multiple AI assets while making sure they all present an industry-specific advantage rather than merely a broad operational capability. Finally, he reminds us of the “virtuous cycle of AI” when designing AI-driven activities: more data -> better product -> more users -> more data -> better product, and so on. Simply put: an effective AI strategy is always an effective data strategy. B for “Blockchain is not going away” When will Blockchain finally deliver on its grand promise? Well, how about 2019?! The past two years saw aroller coaster ride for cryptocurrencies, starting with a breathtaking value increase of 3,252 percent in 2017 and a drop of 60 percent in crypto market value in 2018. Last December, the price of Bitcoin was $19,783, today it is $3,810 (the other two main cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Litecoin, also dropped significantly). With itsretail transactions declining rapidly, the most prominent of these currencies, Bitcoin, may now go into the annals of digital history as the Friendster (remember?) of crypto. But some say this crypto-winter may actually pave the way for different, more sophisticated blockchain applications.Shermin Voshmgir, co-founder of BlockchainHub, director of the Institute of Cryptoeconomics in Vienna, and author of an upcoming book on Blockchain, told me bullishly that this will be the year when Blockchain will grow up beyond Bitcoin and enable a whole new economy: thetoken economy. She believes that Bitcoin, despite its ultimate decline, has pioneered an operating system for “a new type of economy where is has become feasible for everyone to issue their own purpose-oriented token.” Indeed, tokens may create new marketplaces and new incentives to change or exhibit certain behaviors, such as planting trees instead of cutting them by mining “tree tokens” or saving CO2 emissions by biking instead of using the car through mining “Co2 tokens.” Some of these new tokens die on the vine (including, not surprisingly,Kodak’s). But still, as of today, 2,068 cryptocurrencies were listed oncoinmarketcap. Countries such as Venezuela orcitiessuch as Dubai or Lubljana have begun to create their own tokens as an exchange system to foster citizenship and virtual currency for tourists, and others including Berkeley, CA are expected to follow suit. Even soccer clubs such asNewcastle Unitedare considering launching initial coin offerings. Blockchain is also serving as operating system for some transactions that are, although legalized in Canada and some US states, not performed by banks, which is why, for example, a formidable “alternate cannabis token economy” has emerged. Furthermore, applications such asBailBlocdemonstrate how blockchain can be used for good by inviting users to donate their spare computer processing power to create a cryptocurrency named Monero. At the end of every month, the service exchanges Monero for US dollars and donates the earnings to one of the bail funds in the National Bail Fund Network. The transparency and mutual trust that blockchain provides are also perfectly suited for more effective supply chain management, blockchain expert Mark van Rijmenam argues, and he predicts in 2019supply chainswill be the first major enterprise use of blockchain. The revolutionary potential of blockchain is that it assigns and captures value for activities that have previously not been recognized as valuable or have lacked a transparent marketplace. Unlike the average consumer-investor, companies have not seized to pay attention. Consequently, blockchain will be one of the predominant themes at the upcoming World Economic Forum at the end of January, in the official program but even more so at the often more cutting-edge fringe events, fromDavos BlockBasetoDigital Davos. So where doyoustart? Ask yourself these questions: are there activities undertaken by colleagues or in your company’s ecosystem that constitute value that is not captured yet? If so, what kind of token can you launch that is linked to a real product, and how can you harness the token economics in your favor? C for “Community is making technology come home” Technology is not only increasingly social technology (using network effects), it is also a social activity. To adopt the new knowledge–the A and the B–and hone it in your organizations, community of practice is key. AsEdward D. Hess and Kaz Gozdzcontend, in the knowledge economy any successful organization will become a community–a “community of hyper-learners,” “a group of like-minded others of similar values and purpose.” Indeed, community motivates us to learn, creates a common striving (competition for respect among peers), and gives us a sense of belonging, a stable vantage point from which to observe and make sense of the fast-changing digital disruptions we’re all confronted with. No wonder new, alternative communal spaces are booming, from co-working to co-living to co-learning. Studies have shown that these spaces provide not only a sense of belonging, but also increaseself-confidence. Combine these spaces with social learning and tech, and you have a winner. Labs, Meetups, and Basecamps are on the rise. Harvard Business School runs aTech Club, and companies have begun to establish incubators embedded in vibrant urban communities (e.g.Daimler Truckswith its forthcoming Tech & Data Hub in the up-and-coming digital ecosystem of Lisbon) to pool knowledge and practitioners and lower the social barriers to skill acquisition. No longer can a single expert hold all the wisdom or connect all the dots alone. Peer exchange and critical community discourse are crucial for not only accessing but internalizing new knowledge and skills. Moreover, community rituals can help build the kind of muscle memory that initiates and sustains behavior change. In addition, communities are emerging that cater to the need to embrace new tech while also catering to our full selves through meditation, yoga, mindfulness, or other forms of conscious living. Take the co-living communityThe Assemblagein New York, that offers community, professional learning, and personal growth all at once. Or considerThe Learning Hotel, one of Tablet Hotel Magazine’s visions for the “hotels of tomorrow,” a not-yet-realized concept that would tap into the collective wisdom of its guests by curating and gathering them in a meaningful way. When it comes to tech literacy, the intersection of hospitality, experience economy, and social learning is a space to watch. Community is not just the oldest human technology, it is also the enabler of essential human qualities: our ability to imagine alternate worlds through gatherings and stories. More than ever, every effort to strengthen innovation and drive transformation will need to foster these inherently social traits. This is why, as part of their AI strategy, companies should hone their workers’ artistic intelligence and offer art classes. For every pilot project in blockchain, they should treat their employees for a night out at cooking school. Without the C, the A and B are nothing. In 2019, even the most exponential technology won’t be going anywhere if it’s not coming home.

https://medium.com/@bryanlanders/imagine-a-world-where-3baa27a3658d?source=tag_archive---------95-----------------------,Imagine a World Where…,The Story of Your Startup,"The Story of Your Startup Bryan Landers Follow -- Listen Share One of the most crucial jobs of a founder is to tell stories. Origin story, mission story, product story, opportunity story... You tell stories to yourself, your friends and family, co-founders, teammates, customers, investors, and press. Here’s a simple thought experiment extracted from fiction writing to help you tell the story about a future changed by the existence of your product or service. A good science fiction story can be reduced down to a simple framing. “Imagine a world where…” “Imagine a world where…” The quality of the work a writer does to realize a world determines the quality of the story and experience of the audience. What’s the difference between that world and the one we live in now? What happens to the people who live in that other world? What are the greatest challenges they may face? What new possibilities become reality? Here are a few examples. His Dark Materials— a trilogy of novels byPhilip Pullman, includingThe Golden Compass.Imagine a world where the human soul was externalized.The inner-self of each person is manifested as an animal form, which leads to a wonderful dynamic between characters and their “daemons”, giving you clues about their personality and status within the world. The worst fear imaginable in this world would be the splitting of human and soul, which is precisely what the story plot explores. Avatar: The Last Airbender— an animated series by Bryan Konietzo and Michael Dante DiMartino.Imagine a world where people can manipulate the four classical elements of nature: fire, air, water, and Earth.To personify the tension and harmony between the elements, powers for each element are distributed to a different nation in the world and corresponding social attributes result. Give one nation the greed to seek absolute power to thrust the world into an epic drama. The same concept works well when considering startup ideas. Uber/Lyft.Imagine a world where no one owned a car.How would we get around? Who would be the driver? What would change about our cities? Snapchat.Imagine a world where digital photos didn’t last forever.How might people share photos differently? How would that change the content? What would that do to engagement? Airbnb.Imagine a world where anyone could have access to local lodging and experiences anywhere.Who would rent out space in their home? Who would stay in the home of a stranger? What impact would this have on the hotel and travel industries? What tools would need to be created to facilitate these new relationships and interactions? (Bonus note: Airbnb heavily used storyboards to craft their guest and host experiences.) Counterintuitively with startups, the more unbelievable the story premise, the more potentially successful it will be if it works. Transformational, disruptive ideas will often seem terrible until reality proves that they’re not. Interestingly, you don’t always need to sell big cultural or economic transformation to the first users of your product. Uber needed only to convince people that they could push a button and get a ride to take them where they wanted to go. Airbnb needed only to convince people that they could rent a space where they needed to be. The best story to tell is the one that inspires the action you want people to take. You can use this thought experiment to inspire a creative mindset to frame your idea and the resulting consequences to write a compelling story to share when recruiting, fundraising, and selling. What story are you telling? Thanks toSahil Lavingiafor the conversation which inspired this story. He’s the founder ofGumroad, a profitable startup that makes it easy for creators to sell their work. He escaped Silicon Valley and lived to tell the tale, now as an artist and writer in Utah. Sahil recently published his first speculative fiction short story,Across the Border.",Bryan Landers,,113,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*vzlk3F7TFVtK8yw8-EMbbg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*vzlk3F7TFVtK8yw8-EMbbg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*vzlk3F7TFVtK8yw8-EMbbg.jpeg,2019-01-03T05:19:06.365Z,Medium

Martin Basiri,ApplyBoard, Co-founder and CEO. Which country did you emigrate from? I came to the U.S. from Iran. Why did you or your family decide to immigrate? I decided to immigrate primarily because I was seeking a better higher education, and Canada and the U.S. is known to have some of the best schools in the world. In addition to education, like many, I chose to immigrate because I wanted to explore opportunities; to unleash my potential where it counts. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US? As an immigrant, there are many challenges you face. Paperwork processes were one of them, as it was hard to understand what needed to get done and when. However, the number one challenge I faced when I arrived in the U.S. was language. The ability to communicate in words and understand gestures used in daily conversations — you can’t just translate words directly. There’s more to it. All countries have slang and that’s not just something you learn in class or through a podcast. It’s something you learn when engaging with locals. To add to this, understanding the thought process behind the language and gestures; the psychology. Why people say certain things, what people want to hear, etc. Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? (c.f. What triggered you?). Becoming an entrepreneur wasn’t my first thought, nor was it my second or third. I just always had a passion for building things. Since early childhood, I was building things. I always wanted to be in a competitive space and to do something that challenged me and allowed me to further develop my skills. The harder the task was, the more exciting it became to me. Having said that, I became an entrepreneur as a result of my personal experiences. When I set out to study abroad and immigrate to another country, I faced a long list of obstacles. From obtaining the right information about schools and programs to applying for a visa, it was hard. Through this experience, I recognized there is a huge lack of product and software services in this particular area (EdTech). I took it upon myself to launch something; a technical solution to the problem — To challenge myself. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. Did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story.). It was an exciting challenge, trying to raise the funds needed to launch our business. It really was a trial and error, a big learning experience for us as it was all new to us. While overall it began with me saving some money working full-time, I would say the real fun began when we started asking many different people and organizations to support our idea... At the start, we received a lot of negative responses. However, we were persistent. We learned how to create a proper pitch, how to speak the language, and through this, we were able to connect with investors and certain organizations who saw potential in our business idea and wanted to support it. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you first started your business? The most difficult thing we faced was building the company revenue to a million dollars, and that challenge ultimately began with determining how exactly we needed to build the infrastructure of the company altogether. How to make a product that makes money, while still figuring out what the product was exactly, who the market is, the structure, finances, etc. It took a long time to sort through all of this, and while we face daily challenges that make running this company an incredible experience with unique days, I’m always learning and so is my team. What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship? When you decide to move to a new country, you are given the gift of a blank slate. Take advantage of this incredible opportunity and become who you want to be and may have been afraid to be back home. Don’t be afraid of the challenges. Instead, be open and adaptive. Step outside of your comfort zone and get to know the local community instead of seeking a piece of home. This is the only way you’ll get familiar with local norms. Don’t be afraid to take risks or to fail; embrace what’s to come as it’s the only way you’ll learn. You’ll figure it out as you go; you’ll see what practices you can use from home and what practices you can adopt in the U.S. Finally, be positive. Don’t fixate on the things back home and do a compare and contrast on both countries. You left for a reason, so do what you came here to do. Pursue your dreams, accept the changes and adapt to them. Remember, some of the biggest and best companies in the world were launched by first or second-generation immigrants.

https://medium.com/@ColumbiaVenture/columbia-venture-community-venture-engagement-program-winter-2018-cohort-statistics-70486a1dabdf?source=tag_archive---------42-----------------------,Venture Engagement Program: Winter 2018 Cohort Statistics,Summary,"Columbia Venture Community Follow -- Listen Share In November 2018, we launched the first pilot of our Venture Engagement Program, or VEP for short. VEP was designed to connect startups led by Columbia alumni with Venture Capitalists and Serial Entrepreneurs, in order for founders to receive funding and mentorship for their startup. While our Investment Committee completes the review process, we are excited to share some data about this winter’s cohort. Note:If you applied to this year’s winter cohort, please expect to receive notification about the status of your application over email in the next 2 weeks. Summary Average number of co-founders per startup:2.09 Most common school represented:Columbia Business School (36%) Primary business location:Near NYC or in multiple locations Most common industries:E-Commerce, HealthTech, FinTech, and SaaS, representing over 65% of applicants Prior investments:39% of startups have had 0 prior investments Of those that raised, average amount invested:$608,000 Average additional investment sought:$1,105,000 Startups seeking $1M+:21% 1) Startups who applied had an average of 2.09 co-founders. In startups, it is not uncommon to have small founding teams:Startups, especially early stage, are less likely to have enough cash to pay for full-time employees. Co-founders are likely to go months with low or sometimes no form of compensation (Mission). Acknowledging this, CVC and our partner organizations should strive to offer additional resources to help startup founders who may not have the ability to hire or pay themselves. We were curious to research the optimal number of co-founders for an early-stage startup.We foundthis article in 2007, suggesting 2.09. More recently, Ali Tamasebwrote in 2018that 20% of all billion-dollar startups since 2005 had a solo founder, and more than 60% had only 2 or 3 co-founders. 2) 36% of co-founders attended Columbia Business School. We were not surprised by this:Entrepreneurship is a common path for Business School alumni. Students who preemptively decide to pursue entrepreneurship prior to enrolling in their program may also form a self-selecting sample who actively seek resources, such as Columbia Venture Community, to help build their startup. Our marketing may have also skewed towards Business School alumni, as many of CVC’s organizational partners have close ties to alumni and students at GSB. To this end, it is important that Columbia schools and organizations continue to develop entrepreneurial programming, both within and between their programs, in order to spur more connections between potential co-founders beyond select schools. We dug deeper, and saw the average number of years between co-founders who graduated from GSB was 1.6.This suggests that founders may be forming their early teams while in-school, or remain in touch with their classmates when pursuing their idea. In a future analysis, we would like to collect Cluster Information, to determine if GSB alumni are forming startups with classmates in or outside their Cluster. 3) 26% of startups had distributed teams. The distributions ranged from teams in 2 cities to teams in multiple continents;the most common was teams split between New York and Europe. We believe there may be many drivers here, but one idea we hunched was that certain key resources to a successful startup, such as human capital or access to a target market, may be more easily accessible or inexpensive abroad. 4) E-Commerce, HealthTech, FinTech, Consumer Tech, and SaaS represent 78% of startups who applied. There are several macroeconomic trends at play within our cohort: The (Continued) Rise of E-Commerce:Last month, Ally Commerce reportedmore than 57% of 2,000+ consumer brand manufacturers are embracing direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) distribution models, including e-commerce. They are reacting to the success of common household brands like Dollar Shave Club and Warby Parker. Increasing Interest in HealthTech:In Q1 2018, Dreamit Ventures reporteda 10.2% increase of total funding to digital health startup. We foresee this trend increasing as innovations occur in traditional healthcare delivery. Rise of Robo Advisors:Just like at our FinTech panel in September, there is increasing interest for FinTech startups.Last month, Bloomberg reported1,400 FinTech investments in 2018 alone. These categories included digital banking, payments, and emerging market companies. As neo- and challenger-banks continue to build, will the incumbents swing back? Decline in New Social Network Startups:As so-called tech unicorns Facebook and Snapchat continue to battle the United States government, or each other, there seems to be less startup growth in this category compared to other categories with quicker revenue-generating business models. 5) 39% of startups had no prior financial investments. Our team was not surprised to see the skewed distribution in investments between $50,000 and $400,000.Startups generally seek small rounds from friends, family, and angel investors, in addition to self-funding. A majority of our applicants have been in operation for more than 1 year, and have bootstrapped entirely. The average investment in a social network startup who applied was nearly $2 million.The applicants in the social network industry credited their initial funds to friends/family rounds, investment groups, angel investors, with a majority of their funds coming from their investment groups. We theorize this is related to the capital intensive nature of building a social network, including technology, and that they will begin generating revenue later than most startups. 6) 21% are seeking over $1 million in capital. At a high level, funds sought ran the gamut from $23,000 to $15 million.When we dug deeper, looking at industry trends, we found more interesting insights. Startups who applied in the Social Network, SaaS, and HealthTech industries requested 151% more funding than the average applicant.We are not sure of the main driver without learning what the requested funds would be used for. We suspect from our industry knowledge that funding wold be used for a combination of R&D and human capital, primarily engineering and a qualified sales force. We hope you enjoyed learning about the startups who applied to our first cohort as much as we did. We look forward to sharing more results from the pilot in the coming weeks.

https://medium.com/swlh/in-advance-of-the-ces-trek-abd2b189d3d9?source=tag_archive---------114-----------------------,In Advance of the CES Trek,"This story is published inThe Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.","Leor Grebler Follow The Startup -- Listen Share This will be the first year in many (maybe 5+) when I don’t intend to be at CES. I’m looking forward to it! CES gets close to 200,000 attendees and thousands of exhibits spread out over multiple venues. My first visit, the wait for the taxi line was over an hour even though the ride was 12 minutes. The wait to getoutof the cab at the venue was another 10 minutes. Fortunately, Uber has cut down the wait time and it’s maybe 30 minutes to get from the airport to the venues. Of course, getting between the main venues can also be a wait. For the five minute drive between the Sands Expo and the LVCC and the one time I decided to take the shuttle, it was over an hour to get from point to point. Walking for about 30 minutes door to door is the most reliable way. I had seen nearly a 6x Uber surge in between meetings. Over time, I learned how to pack lighter for CES and hone the schedule. Here’s some distilled knowledge: Last year, I had 30 meetings setup over 36 hours and either I or the other party was late about 70% of the time, cascading into being late for the next meeting. Follow up from CES can also be difficult. You wait a few days for everyone to get back home and then the excitement of whatever was presented in the meeting is muted. There are some things that are good at CES: Bonding to clients and partners. Meeting people face to face is not over rated. It humanizes them. Seeing demos first hand. Seeing how other people react to products. Getting a sense of market trends. After the 50th earbud product, you start to get a sense of what the market is demanding. Building your network with new contacts amongst clients. If you do go, stay safe, hydrated and make sure to bring lip balm… the desert is dry.

Follow MESCIUS inc. -- 2 Listen Share Angular is a great platform for building responsive, universal Single Page Applications. All the stable releases of Angular are production ready and deployed by a large number of enterprises and users everywhere. Here, we’ll shift our focus towards the security aspects of Angular. Web development isn’t about writing code that works, it’s also about writing code that’s foolproof and not prone to vulnerabilities. A number of common vulnerabilities for different web applications are regularly brought to light. Vulnerabilities can seep in through obsolete dependencies, bad coding practices, or irregularities in patching updates. In this article, we’ll discuss vulnerabilities that can occur with Angular application(s) and the best ways to circumvent these vulnerabilities. The Angular team is publishing releases at frequent intervals for different feature developments, bug and vulnerability fixes, security patches, etc. Software development teams are strongly suggested to keep their Angular libraries updated constantly to stay in sync with the latest available developments. If not, malicious users may be able to attack the application that is using known security vulnerabilities associated with older versions of the software. With the sheer number of third-party library components available today, it can be a difficult task to develop applications without the use of these libraries. Libraries sometimes can have publicized vulnerabilities that can be maliciously used by attackers to input harmful data or code into applications. Some of the well-known vulnerabilities include CSRF, buffer overflows, XSS, etc. To verify that your dependencies and components are free some of the common loopholes and exploits, you can use opensource vulnerability managementtools. Here is a list of things that you can do to ensure that your code is secure. Always download libraries from a repository like npm or GitHub Use updated versions of libraries and avoid obsolete packages Monitor for vulnerabilities by running an npm audit or use a code analysis tool Regularly visit security resources likeNVD(National Vulnerability Database) andCVE(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) XSS allows malicious users to input client-side scripts into web pages that are accessed by regular users. This code can inflict considerable damage. For example, it’s possible to steal user data or undertake actions that impersonate the user with the intention to cause harm. You can read more about XSS on theOWASP website. In order to systematically and effectively block XSS bugs, Angular assumes each value as an untrusted value by default. Therefore, when a value is entered into the DOM using a template via a property, style, attribute, interpolation or class binding, Angular automatically sanitizes the value and disallows untrusted values. Here is a sample declaration in the BrowserModule: The idea behind the DomSanitizer is to sanitize the input and to clean up user-submitted data. Here is an example of the of what the skeleton of the class might look like: As you would have noticed, there are two distinct patterns. There first is the sanitize method. This identifies the ‘context’ as well as the ‘untrusted value’ and returns a trusted value. The second method uses the ‘bypassSecurityTrustX’ method which captures the ‘untrusted value.’ This is based on value usage and returns the trusted object. In the event that a value is trusted for a particular context, the sanitize method will expose the safe value within it and utilize it directly. If not, the value will eventually be sanitized to be rendered safe based on the security context. Three main functions exist for sanitizing values: The sanitizeHTML function that sanitizes untrusted HTML values by parsing them and verifying its tokens. The sanitizeStlye function that sanitizes untrusted styles or URL values using regular expressions. The sanitizeURL function that sanitizes untrusted URL values using regular expressions. In certain situations where it might be required to disable sanitization, users are able to work around security using a constructed value via one of bypassSecurityTrustX methods. They can bind this to the value from the relevant template. Here is an example: If you’re going to implement authentication in Angular, the best bet is to use a JWT-based authentication system. As a matter of fact, using JSON Web Tokens is the best choice if you’re implementing an authentication system in any Single Page Application (SPA). In a nutshell, JWTs are digitally signed JSON payloads, encoded in a URL-friendly string format. The payload contained in a token defines a user session. This could mean that it contains details unique to the user like userId or emailId. In order to confirm that the token is valid, the server needs to validate the token. What this means is, the server doesn’t have to contact the database to validate the token. The token gets invalidated when it expires, and the expiry time is defined when you create the token. When the user creates an account, the authentication server creates a new token and returns it to back to the client-side application. The token payload assigns something unique to the user (like a userId) and additional details that include the expiry time. The frontend stores this token somewhere — preferably in a cookie and appends the token into the header for all the requests it make. The server validates the token and if the token is valid, the user is able to access the requested resource. When the token expires, the server decodes and checks whether the payload matches the data in the database. If yes, a new token is generated. For more information specific to Angular,reference this article on Angular-University.io CSP or Content Security Policy is an additional security layer that assists in detecting and inhibiting specific types of attacks including XSS and data injection. Such attacks have a goal of data theft to the distribution of malware to website defacement. To enable CSP, you would need to configure your web server to return the correct Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. You can find detailed steps toenable CSP on the MDN website. Angular templates are theoretically executable and therefore the HTML tags, binding expressions, and attributes in templates are trusted to be safe. An attacker may be able to perform something malicious if they’re able to parse an unintended value into the template. To prevent such breaches, users can utilize offline template compilers. This process is also known as template injection. In case you use Angular CLI, you can easily enable AOT: Unfortunately, the built-in browser DOM APIs do not automatically secure the application from security vulnerabilities. As an example, ‘document’ — the node that is available through ‘ElementRef’ might contain unsafe methods. Users should avoid interacting with the DOM through direct means and use Angular templates wherever available. The data validation on the client-side is usually for cosmetic purposes. Someone can try to make direct API calls to the backend with the intention of breaking something. All data on the server-side code needs to be validated and should escape appropriately to inhibit server XSS vulnerabilities. This is largely because injecting template code in an Angular application is similar to injecting executable code directly into the application. It is recommended that Angular templates on the server-side not be generated using a template language. Angular comes with built-in support that can help prevent a couple of common HTTP vulnerabilities — Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF). Both of these vulnerabilities have to be inhibited mainly on the server side. However, Angular also assists helpers to make integration on the client side simpler. XSSI, also known as a JSON vulnerability, enables an attacker’s website to access data using a JSON API. Such attacks work on older browsers by including an API URL via a<script>tag after overriding native JavaScript object constructors. Servers can fend off such attacks by using a prefix on all JSON responses and render them non-executable using the string “)]}’,\n”. The AngularHttpClient library is able to read and strip the string “)]}’,\n” from each response prior to parsing further. XSRF, also known as ‘one-click attack’ or ‘session riding’, is a website violation where unauthorized commands are sent from a web application that is trusted by a user. In usual anti-XSRF methods, application servers transmit a random authentication token via a cookie. The receiving code reads the cookie and includes a custom request header in the token for each following request. The server then makes a comparison between the received cookie value and the request header value and rejects the request in case the values are missing or are a mismatch. The reason this method is effective is because all browsers use the same origin policy. Only the code from the originating website can read the cookies from the site and include custom headers on request. Therefore, only a trusted user application can read the cookie and add a customized header. We’ve covered all the security details that you need to be aware of while building components in Angular. It’s important to take security seriously (it shouldn’t be just limited to front-end). What are your thoughts on Angular security?

https://medium.com/@prashantfonseka/2019-49f8353b29fc?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,2019,Written byJames Prashant Fonseka,"James Prashant Fonseka Follow -- Listen Share I’m starting a new tradition — writing annual New Year’s Eve posts. These will complement my birthday posts and hopefully everything else I write. Sometimes my writings will be brief, and at other times lengthier. Birthday posts are more reflective and centered about my own personal development and evolution while these posts will be more forward looking and touch on subjects well beyond the subjective. There will be some overlap, though, and I’m quite okay with that. Last year’s New Year’s resolution was to have no resolution and live life with no particular goals or aims; to ‘do nothing.’ My intent was simply to take a break. I’d say I largely succeeded and an unplanned side effect was trading off productivity for awareness. I spent more time observing the world and those around me. I spent less time in my own head and more empathizing with others. I suspect dealing with unexpected death, loss, pain, and accidents that happen to have occurred this year was easier than it would have otherwise been in this frame of mind, though of course one can never really know. If I failed in trying to do nothing, it was in doing something. It turns out it’s really hard to do nothing. But let’s say for the sake of exposition that I sufficiently well approximated doing nothing, insofar as feasible. I ask that you grant me some latitude and that we just agree to call whatever I was doing ‘doing nothing.’ Something funny happens when you’re ‘doing nothing.’ It’s almost like what happens when you eat nothing. I’ve really taken to fasting because I enjoy the exercise of will power required to resist hunger. There may or may not be health benefits to this; I don’t know and frankly don’t care. I simply enjoy the feeling. The type of hunger that you experience after not eating for 48+ hours is very different from the hunger you feel when you skip a meal or are excessively stressed. After 48+ hours, you feel hunger not in your stomach but in your fingers and toes. Hunger falls from consciousness into your inner being. The primal sensation is exhilarating and your desire for food transforms from pragmatic to spiritual. I’ve noted a similar effect after dabbling in doing nothing. My desire to do is amplified by doing nothing. Actually, it goes further than that. I thank Professor Niklas Frykman, my senior thesis reader, for my most eye opening lesson in college. The single point that stands out in my memory was that freedom was defined by a lack of it, and that the concept of freedom only made sense in a society where some lacked it. This came up in a course on slavery. He illustrated this point by having us imagine living on an island where we had infinite food and resources with no work, an Edenic paradise of sorts, and pondering the concept of a vacation. Almost self-evidently, the word loses meaning in that world. A vacation only makes sense as the opposite of work and without work it has no meaning. Similarly, action can be best understood through inaction. Doing then may be defined as the opposite of not doing. By doing nothing, I’ve come to understand what it means to do something. I have been feeling a way that re-contextualizes all of my past experiences. Sometimes when I thought I was doing a lot, I was actually doing very little. And at the times when I thought I was doing nothing, I was actually doing quite a lot. This isn’t particularly insightful as it’s a somewhat obvious consequence of the subjectivity inherent to almost everything. What’s more interesting is the mechanism underlying that changing perspective. My simple theory is as follows: in going through the motions of day to day life, we tend to myopically define or perceive what we are doing as what we ought to be doing; in not doing, we are freed to define future action with less of the baggage and bias from past or present action. It’s easy to get caught up in the rat race or stuck in a hamster wheel; I’ll leave it to the reader to choose their preferred rodent metaphor. With time away from doing it becomes easier to see that there are other things that you could be doing and that before, you may not really have been doing much at all. This brings me to the state of world affairs today. By many indicators, these are the best of times, yet many feel like these are the worst of times. There are so many real causes for concern. If you’re a leftist you’re worried climate change will destroy the world. If you’re a rightist you’re worried the rise of illiberal powers will destroy the world. It seems a contradiction that we could be concurrently living in the best and worst of times. But what if we are Icarus flying too close to the sun? I worry that we may be; the systems that hold as together may soon tear us apart. It’s quite easy to argue that capitalism has done more to improve the lot of humanity than any system before, but it will soon fail. The reason for that is simple and was predicted by Marx long ago. Competition drives costs down; technology enables them to go to zero. As the marginal cost of goods and services approaches zero, the value of labor will also approach zero shifting the balance of labor and capital entirely to capital; a self-evidently precarious state for humanity. What will we do when great wealth exists but there are no jobs and wages to be had? As of the end of 2018 — we don’t have a clue. Some talk of universal basic income as a solution, but that would at best be a short-term fix. Socialist societies in which humans derive more of their sense of worth from noneconomic factors may be relatively better suited to weather the storm. But, that’s hardly any consolation given how powerless those nations will be in aggregate relative to the capitalist giants. The economic and military powerhouses of east and west will, in all likelihood, set the course for humanity. I suspect the solutions will have to be as radical and totalizing as the problem. It’s a perilous and exciting time for humanity which makes it an opportune time to be alive. In my own struggles and experiences, I see those of our human collective. As I redefine action in the face of inaction, I envision a future in which I alongside many others work to avoid some of these calamitous situations. That imagined future life seems more purposeful than the one led by many of us today. In 2018 I took a break of sorts and gained some clarity as to what really matters to me and what I ought to do; what sorts of actions I ought to take. There is much that is important to me, but little that I have the power to address today. It’s about time to go back to the drawing board, so that’s what I will do in 2019. Instead of drawing, however, I will write. That is my goal for the new year — to write and publish an essay ever week. Hopefully that habit will endure beyond this coming year, but one must start somewhere. P.S. Though we have yet to agree on the exact terms, my good friend Jon and I will devise a mutual accountability system to ensure that we follow through on our similar goals for the new year. P.P.S.

https://medium.com/@sammyh27/two-main-reasons-why-apple-products-are-super-expensive-5308ea6fedb8?source=tag_archive---------97-----------------------,Two Main Reasons Why Apple Products Are Super Expensive,Written bySamuel Halimanto,"Samuel Halimanto Follow -- Listen Share “No matter how much it cost. There will always be someone who buys it.” “No matter how much it cost. There will always be someone who buys it.” Pricey? Yes it is. Same specs higher price? Yes it is. But there are reasons for it. When you buy Apple product, let’s say iPhone, you don’t only buy iPhone. There are more to it. I make software in my daily life, and of course I get paid by my clients for it. But who pay for the iOS, macOS, and every software Apple makes? Unlike android phone manufacturers, who get their software freely from Google, Apple has to do it’s own R&D (Research and Development) and maintenance for its software. And yes it is very costly. According to appleinsider.com, in Q3 2018 Apple has spent $3.7 billion for R&D. So who pay for it? The answer is, Apple users do! Think about this, the price for every Apple products are including the software inside it. So if you buy an iPhone for lets say $800, maybe $200 in it is the software, and the phone without the software is only $600. That’s why you can’t find other phone using iOS, because they are selling the software too. Not only the software inside the phone. You buy the maintenance and updates for those software too. Lets take iPad 2 which came out in 2011 and got its last iOS update at 2016. If you bought iPad 2 by 2011, you got update for 5 years without having to pay anything more. It’s like a subscription for 5 years that you pay in front. Apple fanboys are EVERYWHERE. No matter what apple do, the fanboy will buy their products. But how? How could people fall in love with “Apple” as a brand without thinking about the specs or anything else? A simple scenario: Two friends coming to you, one uses iPhone, another uses Chinese phone. Your subconscious will think about them differently, won’t it? Why? Because Apple has merged into our lifestyle and it gives luxury to the users. People are willing to pay high to get that Apple logo printed on their devices, because it gives them the luxury. This is why every Apple products are expensive and will always be expensive. Selling something cheap will remove the luxury that Apple gives to the users. Those luxury that Apple gives is not cheap though. First, they have to limit their products to be only the high end products. It reduces their selling. And then the marketing is pricey too. Have you ever seen a bad looking Apple store? Nope, because it’s part of the marketing team to make Apple looks luxurious and exclusive. But, who pay for the selling margin and the marketing fee? Guess who? Despite being really expensive, people still buy it. There are many reasons for it. The hardware, the great design, or even specific needs for a job (like a programmer or designer). Apple products are unique, exclusive, and have its own feel and style. But is it worth the super price though? The answer varies. Here is my thought, in phone industry, as a Galaxy phone owner, I’m on Samsung’s side for now. It does more with lower price, the build quality is better, the hardware is better, and most of all, the display is far more superior than iPhone. For Mac, I think they have the best design and build quality compared to other laptops. But the price is really really high for those specs. The Mac OS is still a little bit behind Windows too in my opinion. But, if money is not a problem for me, I would go for it. In tablet industry, I don’t think iPad has any competitor though. The 2nd best tablet is not even close to the iPad as a king. I will not think twice to buy an iPad if I ever need a tablet. Well, I’m not an Apple fanboy myself, but I think despite being really expensive, Apple has reasons for it and people who buy it have their own reasons too. It’s a matter of preference. So, peace for every tech brand!",Samuel Halimanto,,0,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*sd-XJ8kTqafNKcy0nPsNLg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*sd-XJ8kTqafNKcy0nPsNLg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*sd-XJ8kTqafNKcy0nPsNLg.jpeg,2019-01-07T15:48:37.435Z,Medium

As a kid, I spent my school holidays tagging my “uncles” who drove me around, making deliveries to hotel chains, supermarkets and warehouses. As the new “ah sia kia” (rich guy son) or “towkay kia” (boss’ son) in the office, one of my biggest challenge was to work with the same “uncles” who watched me grew up. What really amazed me when I first plunged into this Supply Chain industry full-time was literally the tonnes of problems I had to solve. I mean, how hard could it be to move goods from one point to another, right? WRONG! I was fascinated by the complexity behind, yet at many times, simply couldn’t understand many of the “hard rules” that people just follow blindly and comply to. Why can’t we do things in another way that can possibly save us more time and efforts? In 2013, I made my 2nd crazy decision to start a Container Haulage business, after my first year in the family business. It was (and still is) very common to get this: “Just follow my way of doing things, when Uncle was doing this, you were still drinking milk.” How best to move away from that than getting into an entirely new business unit that even my Dad is not familiar with? Being young and ambitious, I thought, “How hard can it be to move Containers right?” WRONG AGAIN! I finally understood why my previous contractors were always failing me, why containers are always “On The Way” or that somehow their trucks were either always having a “technical breakdown” or “tyre pangcek” (punctured). It was a challenging job with customers not being able to understand the pains behind your operational incapability. “Don’t make your problem my problem. I pay you to solve my problems, not give me more problems.” “Don’t make your problem my problem. I pay you to solve my problems, not give me more problems.” It was indeed a problematic headache. Despite that, I soldiered on alone, got my hands dirty, spent many sleepless nights alone in my office figuring out how to resolve the countless operational issues with the limited network that I had. I built and scaled the business to a sizeable fleet of 15 trucks within 3 years, and in 2016, I thought I managed to resolve the problem. Not enough truck to service customers,? Just buy more! Invest more! Soon, I began to realize that the larger my business grew, the more problems I had. Every single day, due to limiting capacity and fluctuating demands, I was choosing who to say sorry to. How can I make every customer happy when I only had 15 trucks but I have 25 customers wanting their containers first thing in the morning? How can I make every customer happy when I only had 15 trucks but I have 25 customers wanting their containers first thing in the morning? Over those 5 years of toiling in the traditional logistics industry, I understood the importance of technology and observed the likes of the eCommerce companies changing the entire landscape with ridiculous speed. While the growth of my business was something to be proud of, I was missing out on something special. I was tired of trying to make a change to solve my own company’s daily struggles, when in actual fact, these problems resonate with the rest of my other “friendly competitors”. So in CNY of 2017, I made another crazy decision when I met my current Co-Founder, Sebastian Shen. It was almost as though he was sent into my life by the angels. I barely knew this guy back then, but we both had the same grand ambition — to change this traditional industry through Technology. On the 30th of March 2017, I was a Co-Founder of a Startup. It turned out to be one of the craziest, yet best decision I have made. Over the rest of 2017, we forge ahead to validate our purpose. Can such a traditional space be open to technology? Will the drivers and controllers be willing to put down their pens and papers (finally) to use our system? Will customers want to book a Container Haulage service via a platform when they have already built such strong personal relationship with their truckers over the years? We had many doubts, many questions that challenged our faith in what we both believe in; the Future of Haulage will be one that is driven by Technology. “Uncle thought of this idea 10 years ago la. Young guy, don’t try. Whatever you guys want to do, cannot one la.” “Uncle thought of this idea 10 years ago la. Young guy, don’t try. Whatever you guys want to do, cannot one la.” But we pushed on. The beauty of the marketplace we built came from my experience in the past, when I had to find “friendly competitors” to help with my capacity constraints. With Haulio, we have a plan to help facilitate Job-sharing via our platform across the country. After a successful incubation withPSA unboXed(PSA International’s Corporate Venture Capital arm), we introduced the first of its kind, “on-demand” Inter-Terminal Haulage (ITH) jobs (within PSA Port) to the market, instead of the old ways of supplying a fixed number of trucks via a contractual model with PSA. We ended 2017 by supporting the port with close to 20,000 TEUs completed via our platform with our 50th haulier coming onboard. On the Christmas eve of 2017, I recall having a nice cosy dinner with our newly hired Head of Technology (Goh Chun Lin) & our Haulion #1 (Payne Bao) to round up the year. While taking a stroll back to our mini office to regroup for 2018, we looked up and noticed the continuous movements of the trucks along West Coast Highway, and it was so fitting that PSA is indeed a “Port that doesn’t sleep”. That was when we came to truly understand the importance of the work that we’re embarking on for this forgotten industry and its people. It was a night where we spent working alongside those drivers and port operators with a new mission formulated in our minds.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/most-in-demand-it-jobs-of-2019-2020-bf83d1d37126?source=tag_archive---------10-----------------------,Most In-Demand IT Jobs of 2019–2020,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Skywell Software Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share As a result of digital transformations that many businesses are going through in today’s IT landscape, the jobs that will be in demand will start changing by 2020 and will be more oriented towards more high tech technologies such as AR/VR, AI, and the IoT. The demand for qualified workers to fill these positions is growing as well, which includes commonly found vacancies such as back-end and front-end developer, but there are also some less known ones as well. Let’s take a look at some of the most in-demand IT jobs of 2019–2020. Computer Vision Engineer This is one of the best tech jobs in 2019 because the demand for computer vision engineers has grown at a steady rate over the past five years. Their primary responsibilities include creating and fine-tuning both computer vision and ML algorithms so that they can locate, identify and classify objects. Also, since AR/VR has also grown in popularity and is expected to be a $215 billion-dollar business by 2021, the need for computer vision engineer will also increase because it is directly on Ted with AR and VR. 2. ML Engineer The ML (Machine Learning) engineers create AI systems and machines that are capable of learning and applying what they learned. They conduct advanced programming while working with convoluted datasets and algorithms to train their AI creations. What makes this one of the best technology jobs is that we see pretty much every IT company out there transforming into an AI company, therefore requiring a huge number of investments and making ML engineers a very in demand and popular profession next year and beyond. DDI Editor’s Pick — Machine Learning by Stanford DDI Editor’s Pick — Machine Learning by Stanford 3. App Developer App developer made our list of top IT jobs because it sits at the crossroads of where technical capacity meets business needs. This role does not simply imply coding. We mentioned the popularity of AR and VR earlier and the demand forAR/VR software developerswill also increase. There have been many AR-based games released in 2018 and as well as many other uses of AR and VR and these technologies will be heavily used in 2019. 4. Network Analyst As the IoT becomes mainstream and makes its way into the workplace, there will be a lot more things that will require connectivity in an efficient and easy to use manner, which serves as wind in the sails tech professions such as Network Analyst. They will need to find a way to combine their set of technical skills to produce real-time trending information regarding network traffic and their impact on the company as a whole. Therefore, network analysts will be required to know much more than how sensors work. Future network analysts must possess a thorough grasp of how the entire company operates as well as sound knowledge in AI. These new requirements make this a completely different role than most people are used to. 5. Security Analyst As the number of cyber attacks increases every year and each leak of information is costing companies millions of dollars, one of the jobs trends that is very popular right now and will be in the future, is hiring more and more security analysts. The cyber attacks that we are seeing both in the public and private sector are getting more and more advanced, which means that governments and private companies need to be one step ahead all the time. In 2019, companies will be more proactive in terms of taking on security threats head-on, which means that security analysts will need additional AI and data skills. 6. Business Intelligence Analyst It is helpful to think of the BI analyst as a counterpart to themobile app developer. The business analyst tackles all of the issues concerning the business side of products, taking into account the company’s need in terms of apps to make a process work. It is the job of the business intelligence analyst to collect all necessary data from a wide variety of sources to draw a comprehensive picture of the company’s positioning in the industry and provide recommendations on how to cut costs and achieve growth. 7. DevOps Lead As you start hiring software developers, testers, and BI analysts, you will need to make sure that you have enough DevOps talent on your team in order to coordinate the work between all of these separate groups. The project management skills that they bring to the table are simply indispensable, which go beyond software development. All companies out there want to organize their operations in the most efficient way possible in order to avoid wasting resources and DevOps is a driving factor in delivering software faster with greater efficiency. 8. Database Administrator As companies provide a greater offering of AI-based software, the demand for database administrators will increase since companies will need to be able to maintain databases in a quality manner to make their products work efficiently. 9. Cloud Engineer An increasing amount of companies are moving their vital systems to the cloud and there are opting for a hybrid approach with many vendors. Cloud engineers will need to come up with scalable solutions and combine both in-house technologies with outside systems. 10. User Support Specialist The technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, we will need the help of support specialists more often, which makes this one of the biggest computer jobs in demand. What many people forget is that software development does not end after the release. You still must monitor the performance of the product and provide support to users who are getting adjusted to your product. What jobs will be in demand in 2020? It is difficult to provide a definite list, but we extrapolate the trends that we are seeing on the market today, then the ten jobs mentioned above will definitely be in demand. The jobs of the future in 2020 will be much different from the ones that we are seeing today. Even if the job title will be the same, the job description, skillset, and knowledge needed for performing these jobs will be at the highest level possible. Originally published atskywell.software.

https://medium.com/@wearefospha/was-2018-the-tipping-point-for-data-driven-marketing-a80c58e6f8b0?source=tag_archive---------116-----------------------,Was 2018 the Tipping Point for Data-Driven Marketing?,Written bySam Carter,"Sam Carter Follow -- Listen Share In many ways, 2018 has felt like a transition year for the marketing industry. We have witnessed first-hand a shift in attitudes as the sector has realised data science is becoming no longer a luxury but a necessity. Its application is unquestionably challenging marketing to be more data-driven than ever before. Here are some reflections on 2018 and predictions for this year: Measurement is still critical The size of the prize in data-driven attribution and measurement in 2019 is huge, for two standout reasons. Firstly, an opportunity: data can now be collected and analysed at a scale that enables a better understanding of the customer and their path to purchase than ever before. Secondly, the problem: the same driver of the opportunity in data is resulting in a rate of evolution in AdTech and MarTech with which most marketers can’t keep up. Each new technology, channel or tool adopted creates its own data silo and increases the gap to a holistic understanding of the customer. For these reasons, we believe measurement and attribution are the necessary enabler for data-driven decision making in every facet of marketing. Forrester’s Wave supports this, showing that marketers are increasingly calling for measurement tools that can help them deliver content that effectively targets individual customers. Fortunately, the expectation for what data-science and AI can deliver here are starting to be matched by the reality. Not only will a data-driven approach increase the ROI of emerging channels but it has also been proven to renew the effectiveness of traditional ones in 2018. The remarkable resurgence ofbillboard advertisinghas been driven to a large extent by the fact that the channel has ‘progressed to the point where advertisers can now track nearly all of the same metrics with a billboard as they can with a digital ad’. It’s a fascinating story of how data and measurement have resurrected a ‘relic of the past’ and opened up exciting opportunities for marketers. Nailing down data ethics The advent of the GDPR legislation within the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as the fallout from events such as Cambridge Analytica, have had profound effects. Notably, in May, Google pulled access rights to user-level data within the EEA, preventing marketers from collecting this information for cross-channel measurement and attribution of Display advertising. Google represents 44% of global advertising spend according to Forrester’s October Privacy report and analysts are expecting this new policy to extend globally by the end of 2019. Forrester’s assessment is astonishingly frank, making it impossible to “use independent attribution models for precise, granular-level measurement”. The data privacy changes have certainly resulted in another false start for 360 degree attribution but we have observed an overall positive mentality shift as a result. The new limitations in access to 3rd party data has forced marketers to look inwards, at their 1st party data and for most, there is a treasure trove of future IP and competitive advantage to unlock in the data their brands own. To do that, 2019 has to be the year where marketing starts to commit to breaking down the silos, with unified 1st party data now the foundation for not only better measurement and attribution but also GDPR compliance and data science more broadly. New perspectives on measurement The GDPR and data management challenges have also contributed to changing goals for marketers.Brand awarenesshas climbed to become the number one priority for marketers, overtaking customer lifetime value (CLTV). Whilst the potential impact on business of optimising CLTV is still highly regarded, it’s deprioritised because the data silo problem makes it extremely difficult to measure, let alone optimise. We frequently hear complaints about the lack of effective tools to quantify the impact of different marketing strategies on CLTV. Whilst we knew the industry still had progress to make here, we were taken aback by the lack of progress revealed by some recent survey results. This month, ClickZ research showed us that only33% of marketersbelieve that their measurement tools are accurately delivering accurate attribution across all channels. An even fewer 9% have confidence that their company as a whole has an “excellent” understanding of multi-touch attribution across the lifecycle of a customer. We predict that in 2019, marketers will stop looking at metrics and KPIs in silos too. Whereas in the past, we’ve seen huge swings in sentiment (and spend) from brand marketing to direct response, marketers can now expect their measurement partners to help them understand and optimise the drivers of success at every level, from acquisition to CLTV and the role brand plays in driving both. Customer care will come first In 2018, customer acquisition costs (CAC) rose again, driving an increase ofalmost 50%over the past five years, according to Hubspot research. It is now costing on averagefive times moreto acquire a new customer than it is to retain an existing customer. In this context, we hope to see a move away from the short-term strategies that deliver fast ROI at the expense of long term customer health. We predict that retaining and nurturing existing customers will become more of a business priority for all, backed by the opportunity in the data to get a more granular and complete understanding of the customer and the consequences of marketing activities on them. Certainly, with Amazon continuing its global domination in 2018, built on AI and its principle to ‘start with the customer and work backwards’, there is a good precedent here! More businesses empowered to build better business cases 39% of respondents ranked proving ROI as theirbiggest challenge for 2019. Interestingly, this was closely followed by 27% telling us they feared not getting enough capital for their budgets. Clearly, marketers are still not able to objectively prove the effectiveness of either specific channels or their broader strategy. We’ve written about the opportunity in marketing measurement and attribution that data science is opening up, from identifying channels underrepresented by out-of-the-box attribution models in Google Analytics todrilling into channelsthat are traditionally overvalued. It appears from the Hubspot survey that it’s also becoming a business imperative. CFOs and CEOs are expecting CMOs to be a revenue-driving function… and be able to communicate through the data how they are going to drive it. Integrating data specialism into your teams Data is fast becoming the basis for all competitive advantage in marketing and it’s critically important that we organise our teams in the same way. It is no longer sensible or even possible to segregate data specialists and traditional marketers. Companies must sponsor communication and continual learning between both groups. It is not necessary for marketers to have all these data skills but it is crucial to understand their importance and application. It is up to managers to ensure this collaboration takes off and thrives. In 2018 we reached the tipping point, where the application of data has become a prerequisite for marketing success. The future is certainly bright for those willing to embrace the emergent technologies and foster cultures that make data central. It is easier than ever to start and we believe that a ‘Start Small & Grow’ approach is fundamental to success, finding what works for you and building from there. We can’t wait to see where you get to in 2019 and would love to connect to share notes on your plans.

Bem, paraFlorence Rena Sabinela devia ser constante. Vamos entender o por quê. Ela nasceu em 9 de novembro de 1871, em Central City, Colorado, Estados Unidos da América. Em 1893 graduou-se no Smith College, em Northampton e, após ensinar matemática por dois anos em Denver e zoologia no Smith College por um ano, ela foi a primeira mulher a ser aceita na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, no ano de 1896, onde construiu uma grande reputação por conta das suas pesquisas em embriologia e histologia. Florence se tornou uma anatomista, por isso acredito que a pergunta do início do texto lhe era muito recorrente. Um outro grande feito de Florence Rena é que ela foi a primeira mulher eleita para a National Academy of Sciences e uma das primeiras mulheres médicas norte-americanas a construir carreira como pesquisadora. Em 1900, recebeu o título de Doutora pela Johns Hopkins e em 1901 publicou “An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain”, um livro de texto sobre medicina que se tornou muito popular na época. No ano seguinte, a Johns Hopkins finalmente revogou sua política de não contratar mulheres e ela passou então a integrar o staff de pesquisadores. Destacou-se como pesquisadora do sistema linfático, onde reformulou a explicação tradicional do desenvolvimento do mesmo, provando que o desenvolvimento das veias no embrião ocorre fora em tecidos. Foi ainda professora de histologia na Johns Hopkins University entre 1917 e 1925, e membro do Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research entre 1925 e 1938, onde se aposentou e tornou-se emérita. Voltou a morar em Denver, Colorado, onde trabalhou para o governo do estado. Ufa! Quanta coisa a Dra. Sabin fez e contribuiu para a ciência. Suas pesquisas ajudam até hoje no entendimento embrionário.

https://medium.com/@kidinamoto/setup-cosmos-validator-relay-network-6b6e63661100?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,Setup Cosmos Validator Relay Network,P2P VPN solutions,"Sophie Huang Follow -- 1 Listen Share This is Part III of a series of posts dedicated to exploring the topic of staking and validation as Cosmos Validator. With launch of Cosmos Hub coming, we will witness the biggestadversarialBFT distributed network. Though Tendermint gives us safety, we still need to fight for liveness of network. In this article, I will talk about how to defend the liveness with relay nodes. Part I.Anti-DDoS solution for validators Part II.Key Management System for validators The first adversarial testnet of Cosmos, akaGame of Stakeshas just started a few days ago. It was the largest BFT network ever existed with 200+ validators securing the consensus of network. As a permissionless public blockchain, we see validators come from all over the world. According to some network traffic analysis within validator community, we see an imbalance data outbounded from different cloud server providers. A majority of data come from USA , then Europe and Asia counts for less than 10%. My guess is price difference leads to this location clustering. Since Cosmos-SDK is based on Tendermint and we need to collect 2/3+ signatures from all the validators, this kind of geo distribution gives some validators inadvantage. To become a well connected network world wide, more work needs to be done. And today I’d like to promote the idea of relay network. There are already some discussions about what a validator operator should do to build a reliable infrastructure. Thesentry node solutionis to make validator node resilient to DDoS attack, which is the most common attack factor in Comsos network. The discussion about sentry node leads to the idea ofrelay-node. According to Zaki, A Relay Node is a full node that only make persistent connections to white list IP of sentry nodes of other validators. It runs with pex disabled and . The firewall on the Relay node blocks all connections from ip address other than what is on a white list. A Relay Node is a full node that only make persistent connections to white list IP of sentry nodes of other validators. It runs with pex disabled and . The firewall on the Relay node blocks all connections from ip address other than what is on a white list. The sentry node architecture will make each validator node strong, while relay node network will establish private connections between several validators’s sentry nodes. And relay nodes will consume less resources than public sentries. The logical layout is illustrated below: In this relay node network, there are two validator nodes: A and B. The trusted links are established between relay node of A and B. In this way, even when public sentries of B are totally not working, B’sprevote&precommitmessage could still be gossiped to the whole network though B’s public sentry could be attacked or connected with unreliable peers. In the future, we should be able to see several relay node clusters: Asian cluster, European cluster and American cluster. Every validator won't have to have a public sentry in every cluster. He only need to make sure his relay node is well connected to join a joint VPN network. Traffic will be reduced due to fixed connections and less resourced required. P2P messages from Tendermint will still be gossiped around the world and reach consensus. P2P VPN solutions A virtual private network establishes a secure private network across a public network. The key to build a relay network is to have a VPN connection. Most traditional VPN solutions follow the client-server principle, which means that all participating nodes connect to a central server. This creates a star topology, which leads to single point failure. A virtual network built by P2P VPN uses a full mesh topology. All nodes talk directly to each other, there is no need for a central server. If one node goes down, the rest of the network is unaffected. Next, I will talk about how to setup relay node network with the help of 2 popular P2P VPN solution. Tincis a Virtual Private Network daemon that uses tunneling and optional encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. Tinc is free open source software. Since this VPN works at the IP level network (layer 3) as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt existing software. This allows VPN sites to share and send information with each other over the public Internet on a secure way without exposing the information to others. Features of Tinc are: Minimum adaption for existing software Encryption, authentication and compression Automatic mesh routing and fully decentralized management. Easily expandable VPN Runs on many operating systems and supports IPv6. The key advantage of using tinc is that it’ll automatically configure all your nodes as soon as you connect a new one, effectively creating a mesh network of VPN endpoints. This also means that if one of the nodes fails, your remaining nodes in the mesh should continue to function without any issues. How to Install To set up a two-node VPN with Tinc, you need to installtincon each server. Both of these machines are connected to the internet and are able to reach eachother. Install Tinc 2. Create config files/etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conffor Tinc on relay1: Name- This is a daemon-specific name within the VPN. It should be unique. Device- Determines the virtual network to use. Tinc will automatically detect what kind of device you are using. AddressFamily- Tell tinc which type of address to use. Now you need to generate the relay2’s configuration file /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conf in similar way: ConnectTo- This value points to the tinc daemon you want to connect. 3. Create thehostsconfiguration file. Because tinc is built using a peer-to-peer model each node needs to communicate with the others. The basic host file for the application server is:/etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 Similarly, create a host file for the second relay node:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/relay2 4. Add the public key of each node. tinc can create the key pair using the following command: This creates the private key (/etc/tinc/relaynet/rsa_key.priv) and appends the public key to the ams hosts configuration file that we recently created (/etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 ). 5. Create VPN Control Scripts Control scripts are responsible for setting up virtual interfaces on each server. They’re needed on both servers. From the application server, create the following file to enable the tinc interface:/etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc-up Create a script to disable the interface:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down Create a similar set of scripts on second relay node. After creating the control scripts, you will need to change the permissions on both servers: 6. Test tinc Start thetincddaemon on the first relay node: Do the same on second relay node: If everything was configured successfully, you should see an output similar to this: Then you could a quick test withpingbetween two relay nodes using its VPN address. Great! Now you could use VPN addresses for connecting relay nodes. PeerVPN is a software that builds virtual ethernet networks between multiple computers. Such a virtual network can be useful to facilitate direct communication that applications like file sharing or gaming may need. Often, such direct communication is made impossible or very difficult by firewalls or NAT devices. Features of PeerVPN are: Ethernet tunneling support using TAP devices. IPv6 support. Full mesh network topology. No NAT reconfiguration necessary, only one node with a public address is required. Shared key encryption and authentication support. How to Install Download the binary files to your servers fromhere Createpeervpn.conffor each node. This will open UDP port 7000 and create a virtual ethernet interface with the name peervpn0 and the IP address 10.0.0.1. 3. Test Similar to tinc to test if everything works, start PeerVPN on both nodes. Each node should now have created its own peervpn0 interface. It may take some time until the VPN tunnel is built. Try to ping 10.0.0.2 from one node or ping 10.0.0.1 from another. If you get a response, the VPN has been set up successfully! In this article, I explained two ways to build a P2P VPN network for Cosmos validators. Relay nodes will play a key part in establishing a world-wide validator network. I wish to see more implementation of P2P VPN network in testnet.

Durr-e-Nayab, a programming teacher at the University of Engineering & Technology in Peshawar, Pakistan, is an exception. She has always been curious. Her earliest memories are of tearing apart her toys. She imagined herself as an engineer who built programs and designed things. “I really looked up to my brother, who was an engineer,” she says. “Luckily, my parents encouraged me to follow my interests.” Nayab opted for a computer science postgraduate degree and began teaching at the Computer Systems Engineering department at UET Peshawar. She is also pursuing a PhD. Seeing her passion, the university management nominated her for a training offered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) called theSkills for Youth Program (SYP). Through SYP, youth in the critical stabilization regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas learned Information and communications technology skills and were linked to employment opportunities. Nayab enrolled in Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Routing & Switching and CCNA Security training. Thanks to the hands-on experience with networking, she is now able to explain concepts to her students in a more engaging way. “SYP was different because we were taught as future instructors,” she says. Aside from becoming a better teacher, Nayab also has the option to work in the field. “There is a difference between theoretical knowledge and practicality, and this training has helped me bridge that gap,” she says. Soft skills were also a focus of the SYP program. Nayab said the sessions on public speaking were particularly helpful, and today, with both subject knowledge and confidence, she often takes the lead in faculty meetings and is seen as a candidate for a senior leadership position. Nayab is the first woman in her family to pursue a technical education. She is an inspiration for her younger cousins and nieces. It’s clear that Nayab is not only breaking stereotypes, she’s bringing change to society around her.

https://medium.com/innovation-and-technology/from-summer-fellow-to-full-time-employee-ab27ed0ce5ab?source=tag_archive---------98-----------------------,From summer fellow to full-time employee,Rebecca Gray shares her perspective on the transition from fellow to full-time analyst at the City of Boston’s Department of Innovation and Technology.,"Rebecca Gray shares her perspective on the transition from fellow to full-time analyst at the City of Boston’s Department of Innovation and Technology. City of Boston Follow Innovation and Technology -- Listen Share Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT)fellows have the chance to act as problem solvers on behalf of the City of Boston. After completing an Analytics fellowship last summer, I joined the citywideAnalytics Teamas a full-time data and performance analyst. My fellowship gave me an inside perspective on what it takes to move a large data project forward and develop strong working relationships in the context of local government. Thinking of applying? In case you’re on the fence, here are my thoughts on what a summer at DoIT can offer. As a DoIT fellow, you will be stationed at the heart of timely, impactful work (not to mention the heart of Boston). During my fellowship, I worked with theBoston Public Health Commission (BPHC)to expand healthcare access in the City. Together, we built a web-based app to guide health insurance applicants through the enrollment process. At DoIT, you can grow as a data analyst without sacrificing your penchant for civic engagement. DoIT fellowships are structured with your development in mind. A personal mentor will help you scope and execute a long-term project based on your personal interests. My mentor brought valuable experience in both data science and project management to my fellowship. She was — unwaveringly — in my corner, whether that meant proofreading an email, troubleshooting over coffee, or simply sharing stories of her own experience as a public servant. This summer, skip the busy work. DoIT will equip you with the time and tools to develop robust, polished deliverables. Data is only as powerful as our ability to communicate its meaning. At DoIT, we work with data from departments across the City. Frequent, two-way communication is therefore critical to building trust and ensuring project success. One example? My teammates at BPHC loved the first iteration of my app, with one caveat: many Bostonians speak a primary language other than English. Seeking their feedback allowed me to include multilingual app features, and thus create a more accessible product. Spearheading your own project means ample practice in stakeholder communication and data translation — skills that will come in handy long after your fellowship draws to a close. Right now, you can apply to join our team as aDigitalorAnalyticsfellow for summer 2019. Not sure if you qualify? Don’t count yourself out. In the past, DoIT has welcomed awesome fellows from many disciplines, including engineering, geography, public health, and urban planning. If you enjoy solving problems with data and are energized by public service, then you are who we’re looking for. And who knows — you could end up on the team for good!",City of Boston,https://medium.com/@CityOfBoston?source=post_page---byline--ab27ed0ce5ab---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*O6IlS1AjPT5454Io.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*_JLNKx2yqO48v9JV-Py0Ng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_JLNKx2yqO48v9JV-Py0Ng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_JLNKx2yqO48v9JV-Py0Ng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*O6IlS1AjPT5454Io.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*O6IlS1AjPT5454Io.png,2019-01-02T18:50:14.131Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@maddyraj/happy-new-year-2019-6653a1d39bea?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,Happy New Year 2019 !!!,Written byMaddy,"Maddy Follow -- Listen Share Another trip around the sun, New year is like the birthday celebration of the earth. Everyone on earth is happy, motivated, enthusiast about something refreshing and so much positive vibe all around. Quarter of contacts are live on Instagram and others are also busy in writing digital history for their kids. Our WhatsApp message box is full of happy new year wishes and our mind is full of opportunity to look forward. Once Albert Einstein said : LEARN from yesterday, LIVE for today, HOPE for tomorrow Lets see what I have in my list to look in 2019. Technology, Programming languages, Books, Traveling, Sports and many more thing. Here I am going to share some of hot stuff to watch. Artificial Intelligence:- AI gradually impacting in our life, The way we live, work, play and communicating to smart devices. AI is everywhere in modern lifestyle. We all are using some sort of AI which may include App assistance, chat bot, navigation services or smart Apps. The speed which we are going I won’t wonder if the 2024 presidential election in the USA will Siri vs Alexa or Cortona vs OK Google. The whole purpose of AI is to create intelligent machines. A machine which has problem solving power and can perform difficult and tedious task by own. A machine which can learn from the input provided and give some accurate outcome. AI can learn and perform by the given set of input, which turn into the model to the next result. AI is an essential toolfor problem solving. Machine learning and Robotics are also very important part of AI. 2.Machine Learning:- Machine learning is sub branch of AI where machine learn by discovering pattern insights from data. Machine learning is programmed in such a way to handle the request by using analysis, self-training, observation and experience. Data play a big role in this concept. Well in 20th century Machines run on oil then in century machine will run on data. We have achieved remarkable amount of success in this technology and it is growing bigger and bigger. I will come out how machine learning works with algorithm and its example later this year. For Machine learning example you can see my blog. This is must watch and learn technology in 2019. 3.Blockchain:- Blockchain in 2019 is more beyond than cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Simplest way to define blockchain is you can add data to chain, not take away from the chain. We are here making chain of data. Blockchain providing security with may other ways. The blockchain also provide transparency for transactions in every crypto transaction.Blockchain can change complete global supply chain cycle. Major of the big technology giant and financials firms are adopting to this technology on a big scale. Finance, Retail, Healthcare are having major potential fields to adopt this technology. 4.Internet of Things:- In simple term Internet of Things(IOT) define as Internet enabling in smart devices to send and receive the data. IOT involves extended internet connectivity beyond the regular devices like desktops, laptops and mobile. It involve great range of device which is used in smart home appliances, commercial application, automation, transportation, manufacturing Industry, Agriculture and many more. Huge amount of IOT application are developed to support these devices. IOT is definitely will be the next big thing of coming decade. In this year IOT will keep that pace with some addition in new domain. 5.Virtual Reality: Virtual Reality is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. In Past years we saw its transition from a curiosity into a tangible tool. In 2019 this will be hot topic along with mixed and argument reality. Code Simplicity : The Fundamentals of Software— Unfortunately, much of the code existing in the world today is far too complex. No coder wants to write complex code and this book will helps us to understand the fundamentals of good software development through universal laws. Blue Ocean Strategy-This book is written by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne originally published in 2004. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves spanning more, and thirty industries Author come to the conclusion that companies can get success by creating blue ocean of uncontested market space, as opposed to “red oceans” where competitors fight for dominance. Will share, the more details on this after getting insights. Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken-The story of a secret barrister a non fiction is published in 2018. This book is based on the criminal case. A life cycle of criminal case from magistrates’ court, through to sentence and appeal. How as lawyer, author handles the case and its conclusion. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century —Israeli author Yuval Noah Harari written this book, who already published book “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” which is must read book for everyone. Impressed by his Sapiens and its quite agree with actual theories, this year i am looking forward to read another controversial piece “21 Lessons for the 21st Century”. The Army of none —Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War — Name itself is exciting. Isn’t it. One of the book by Bill Gates Top 5 book. Much need to understand about Pentagon defense. ReactJS: ReactJS is a javascript library for building user Interface and Handel view layer of web and mobile application. This front-end library developed by Facebook. Reusability is one of the main feature of ReactJS. In current time this is one of the most popular javascript libraries. According to stack overflow data the rise in reacting developer increasing. Also the interest of enterprise level application also bends towards react. 2019 will be interesting years for ReactJS developers. Python: Python is still favorite for many. Lots of companies these days are using python. Easy implementation of the algorithm is making python a unique language. Python will be on top in this year as well. Javascript: The updated javascript version is coming with many features this making javascript great again. According to stack overflow JS is most used programming language across the world. Javascript has lots of framework which performs or fit for specific task. Which is actually the beauty of javascript. You take vue, Angular, Ember and etc. Javascript will be favored among the developer in 2019. Java: Java is fourth in my list. Well Java is developed to overcome the complexity of C++. Its popularity cannot be overstated. Every day by day Java is becoming more and more comfortable for a variety of domains. Most of the big companies are using Java for their back end development. Java is still the first choice of many developers because of the APIs and the work Java can do. SQL: SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. Though many alternate database raised throughout the times but SQL is impressive. Things I am going to keep eye on in 2019 General Election: I am going to enjoy the festival of democracy. These are the few perks to live in India. Hope everything will be smooth and the next government will do their best to make India better place to live. Game of Thrones: Winter has arrived. Being a Lannister fan, its hard for me to watch the epic TV series and but I am damn sure this gonna be ultimate fun. Now its all about whose fan theories is near to truth. Remember “When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die. There is no middle ground”. ICC World Cup 2019: I want Virat Kohli to hold the cup in balcony of Lords. This event can bring smile of 1 billion people. Common Team India. #BleedingBlue Next Boss of Manchester United to Speed of Lewis Hamilton. My next internet creation (Kinda excited about that) to Dallas cowboys. Many challenges are ahead to tackle but yaWe Can Do It. (Soon I am go to publish story on Man Utd mess and gadgets to watch in 2019. Stay Tune) Welcome to 2019 ! My message for 2019 to you isStay Awesome Stay Blessed. Keep creating cool stuff.

But, what if your stereo never had a remote in the first place, or it doesn’t work for your volume control setup? Plenty of vintage stereos sound great and can be found at bargain prices, but lack fancy modern conveniences like a remote control. If you find yourself with one, you canfollow Redditor justikowski’s lead and add a motorized remote volume control mechanism. justikowski’sstereois used for all of their living room audio needs, but the setup doesn’t have any remote volume control. They couldn’t just purchase a universal remote, because the stereo simply doesn’t have the capability. It might have been possible to hack the stereo itself to add that functionality, but the solution they came up with is easier — and it looks cool as heck. The solution is to set upan Arduinowith an infrared receiver, and have it spin a stepper motor. A belt loops around the motor’s output and the stereo’s volume knob. The Arduino can be programmed to accept infrared commands from any button on any remote, so it’s easy to use whatever remote you already have on hand. The Arduino and motor are packed into a simple3D-printedenclosure made from black ABS, so it blends in seamlessly with the other devices on the entertainment center.",Cameron Coward,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward?source=post_page---byline--dedcb275d250---------------------------------------,46,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg,2019-01-02T22:36:40.131Z,Medium

That rebel act enabled progress and civilization for thousands of years. But, there is a more powerful element in nature and we stole it from Zeus’ own hands. We stole the power of Light! Picture this: In 1662, the idea of having a conversation face-to-face with another person while both of you were in different villages was considered sorcery🧙🏼‍♂️.And today we have Skype, FaceTime, and WhatsApp. In 1865, to orbit the Earth’s atmosphere or visit the moon was something only imaginable in aJules Verne’s novel.And today we plan to surround the planet with satellites to provide wireless internet (Starlink🛰) and also to colonize Mars. In 1913, to speak of self-driving automobiles could have been the source of mockery.Soon we will delegate driving to a machine rather than feeling the stress of rush hour or risk receiving aDUIticket. In 1980, to materialize a mechanical piece would have been considered highly advanced technology.And today we can3D-print entire houses. None of those feats would have been possible had we not dared to tame the untamable. It’s said that Benjamin Franklin discoveredelectricitybut maybe it was, in fact, a gift from the gods to humankind to see what we could achieve with it.

He scored a job in a pizza shop, but found himself missing the girlfriend he had left back home. As a Valentine’s gift, he wrote a song in his bedroom for her, wistfully crooning against upbeat synthesisers. He uploaded the song, called “Me Rehúso”, to YouTube and Spotify. It began creeping up Spotify’s viral charts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which caught the attention of Spotify’s curators — the employees who monitor minute-by-minute listening data. They unanimously agreed to add it to their playlists, such as “Verano Forever”, where Spotify’s users lapped it up. Week by week, Spotify added it to more playlists, each with bigger followings, until two months later the song made it to the holy grail — “¡Viva Latino!” — which has the clout to catapult unknown acts into stardom.

https://medium.com/@shawn_hamman/when-technology-and-humanity-collide-efe937119948?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,When Technology and Humanity Collide,Written byShawn Hamman,"Shawn Hamman Follow -- 1 Listen Share I’ve found that some of the most interesting ideas are formed around the messy, rapidly developing blending of technology and humanity. One such techno/human fusion is Twitter, a place where somewhat slow-changing society and culture comes up hard against fast changing technology, creating inevitable emotional turbulence and much uncertainty, while furiously generating and spreading new ideas and new concepts. That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views, as annoying as this sometimes is. I came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature, technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck, self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores. It suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score, with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and, if I were a betting man, I’d put money onmostpeople thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant. I wondered, would it actually be awful? And if so,why would it be awful? Self-Driving Cars A particularly tricky problem to solve in a self-driving car system is, for all intents and purposes, dealing with the real world manifestation of the classic ethicalTrolley Problemthought experiment. Given an anticipated accident scenario where death or injury to somebody is unavoidable, how should a self driving car’s software ethically decide who the victim should be out of a set of options? For example, the software of a car might detect that an accident is inevitable and it has detected two categories of object in front of it and the only option available to it is avoiding one category of object over the other. Should it — the software — choose to drive into one child instead of a group of adults? Should it pick a couple of old people to die over a single young person? Should the car always save the driver over any other people? This is not a trivial problem to overcome and no doubt there will be extreme disagreement on how it eventually gets solved. It’s become a very real challenge for the legion of programmers working on what will likely be one of the most profound changes to society to date (and, in my opinion, the most interesting software challenges in the world to be working on right now). Is it even possible to have an acceptable way of rank ordering the value of people when it comes to making life and death decisions? The Implications of Automation and Decision Delegation Most people don’t need to think through ethical conundrums like theTrolley Problemand throughout history this kind of thing has generally been left to philosophers and clergy to contemplate. We, as a species, are now rapidly moving past the information age and into the age of automation; the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the confluence of technologies blurring the lines between the physical and the digital. Breakthroughs in a number of fields are driving this revolution forward — robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, hyper-connectedness through high bandwidth, the (industrial) internet of things. What perhaps isn’t so obvious is that using artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation technologies (especially complex automation technology like self-driving cars) is effectively delegating and outsourcing the (increasingly more often) serious and complex (andethical) decision making to machines. By its nature, solving a problem with software typically requires programmers to formally codify in excruciating detail the decision making or solutioning process. For complex decisions this is extremely challenging and sometimes impossible. This difficulty, along with improvements in computer hardware and access to large amounts of data has driven the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence forward. One of the issues with artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning in general is that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to explain exactlyhowa decision is made or a result obtained because of the nature of how problems are solved by the technology and the nature of the problem space to which it is applied. This is a real impediment when trying to determine accountability, particularly in high-consequence scenarios. Ironically this means that delegated decision making in something like the automation of driving inherentlyrequiresus — programmers, people — to either address and formally answer complex ethical challenges like theTrolley Problemfor all possible scenarios by hand or employ nearly-opaque, nearly-black-box technology that makes it difficult or impossible to explain how a decision was made. Addressing theTrolley Probleminherently means having to, at some point, rank people (or categories of people) in order of preference: who to kill and who not to kill. Will it be important to us as a society and as individuals to know exactlyhow and whya machine decided that one person lived while another died? Would it be better if a decision was made taking into account as much data about the individuals as possible? Or will simpler, impersonal categorical choice be acceptable, perhaps even be preferred? Social Credit Widely reported this year (Business Insider;Bloomberg), the Chinese central government, ever practical and efficient authoritarians, are said to be leveraging Big Data technology and ubiquitous surveillance to implement an explicit “social credit scoring” system, effectively standardising the assessment of each citizen’s business, economic and social reputation. If one thinks about it, in the West (whether intentionally or not), various social media combined with credit scores already can (and do, effectively) function as an implicit social credit score. Whether planned or haphazard, both implicit and explicit scoring mechanisms seem to have similar and largely punitive outcomes: say or do the wrong things where your score is measured and you could lose your job or access to opportunities. Generate a bad credit score and access to financial or social services could become more challenging. Interestingly, the very idea of a planned social scoring system seems to be universally reviled in the West. Most people I’ve come across with an opinion on the topic — like the tweet that started this off — flinch at the thought of what the Chinese government might be up to. It seems extremely dark and dystopian with what we imagine to be some terrible consequences. The very concept seems to bring up a natural revulsion and I’ve seen it described in many negative terms: “awful”, “terrible”, “shuddering at the thought”, “worrying”. The US Vice President Mike Pence described it as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life.” The push-back against the pervasive, already implemented Western platforms of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube doesn’t seem to be quite so vociferous, however. I can’t help but wonder if it’s the more explicative central planning approach that resonates too much with Communism, or a just bit of a cultural blindspot at work there, where much is forgiven or overlooked in the name of capitalism and profit. On Trust I think there are two primary reasons for people (in the West at least) to be deeply skeptical of the planned, explicit Chinese social credit scoring system. The first and obvious one lies in the judicious granting of trust to those who would define, operate and apply such a scoring system. Can the people who are trying to implement this system be trusted to implement it fairly, securely, impartially and keep it from being abused? Can the system, even if implemented initially to meet the aforementioned conditions, be guaranteed to stay that way over time? I think the easy answer is no, it’s not likely or at the very least extremely difficult to get right. The consequences for getting it wrong seem like they could be pretty dire. An interesting counterfactual to contemplate is if, for the sake of argument, a social credit scoring system could be implemented and operated by a completely trustworthy, fair and impartial, benevolent super AGI, able to take into account all aspects of a person to generate the score, would there still be an objection to the concept? Is there utility in having a “social credit score”, implementation and operation aside? The second reason for Western skepticism of the concept of a social credit score is that it seems to boil down to another class system, albeit a significantly more complex and granular one. The way society seems to be trying to reduce competition in schools and the prevailing social justice opinions that seem to be insisting on equality and equity in all things doesn’t align very well with the concept: instead of having two or three classes (which already exist), the social credit score can effectively be an infinite number of individual classes and the presentation of this is much starker. The very concept tries to quantify the worth of one individual over the other which isn’t a particularly palatable approach, particularly in the West. That, in itself, is worth considering: why is quantifying the worth of individuals and ranking them so off-putting? On Luck A third and perhaps less obvious reason is that what a “social credit score” is measuring is in fact not value or reputation exactly, but rather an aggregate of a subset of an individual’s luck across an arbitrarily chosen number of measurable dimensions. Most if not all things about a person comes down to luck. It is the extremely unpalatable but entirely factual way of the universe. The genes you’re born with, the family you’re born into, the city, state, country you happen to be born in, the environment you grow up in, the air you breathe, the food you eat, the people who surround you, the culture you exist in: none of it is your doing. You made none of the choices for your circumstance or any of the things that you physically are. The choices you think you’ve made were made with the mental machinery that you had no influence in creating, that was entirely determined by what came before you, by the genes you were conceived with and where you happen to have come into being. By chance. Luck: good, bad or ugly. Everything about you and me and everybody else is a measure of luck along some dimension. The difficulty with a social credit score then is that it is an imperfect measure of how lucky or unlucky a person is. The trouble is that nearly all societies take a punitive approach to non-conforming and non-performing individuals. Once you realise that a person’s disposition is effectively due to luck and their actions too are due to luck — good or bad — punishing bad luck and rewarding good luck seems somewhat cruel. Quantifying how lucky a person is to inform decision making about an individual in the context of society — even if that quantification is useful or valuable in predicting future behaviour and a net benefit to society as a whole — without a commensurate change in the society from a punitive to a supportive and restorative approach with regard to misbehaviour seems intuitively unfair. Conclusion Even if cultural differences (between East and West perhaps) cause the concept of a social credit score to be looked at differently, the tsunami wave of big data technology, fanatical metrics collection, pervasive social media and the hyper-connectedness of everything has meant that people are being quantified and scored whether they know it, like it or not. It is happening. For the moment, purportedly explicitly in the East, and definitely implicitly in the West. Whether this scoring will turn out to be a net benefit to society or not remains to be seen. That same technology wave is also forcing forward progress in automation which will inevitably mean machines making serious ethical decisions on our behalf and it is not clear if we will prefer those ethical decisions to be made with hyper-personal data — something like social credit scores — or if we’d be more comfortable with semi-anonymous, categorical decisions. The near future will surely be some of the most interesting years in human experience.",Shawn Hamman,,1,9 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*tMfJdJbl9P187uc6g4V6iQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*tMfJdJbl9P187uc6g4V6iQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*tMfJdJbl9P187uc6g4V6iQ.jpeg,2019-01-01T08:37:45.360Z,Medium

XD helped me to build the UX in an hour. Previously, I’ve used CorelDraw & Photoshop to build the UI. First time created UX prototypes using XD. After explored the lot of tools in Amazon Web Service (AWS), for a project, I had a good chance to work with GCP. Created the secured network with three different kinds of applications on each machine and tied all those things with the firewall and the Virtual Private Network (VPN). Started using Wacom Intuos Pen-Tablet with MS-Powerpoint & MS-Word applications to make the meeting notes in my own style. Even though the application of Wacom pen tablet is for creating arts, I used this as the note making tool. Created my own Slack slash command for fetching and showing the github issues. So that, I could get the current status of the github issues of the specified repository. Created slack bot to show the notification of the automation workflow.

How do senior tech leaders remain technical? Every winter break, I find myself looking to evaluate and/or go deeper in a technology that I want to better understand heading into the new year. This appears to be very common in thetwitterversebased upon a non-scientific twitter search of“holiday write code”. With technology, there are constant disruptions that if you do not pay attention to, you will quickly fall behind the disruption curve. One of the largest disruptions we have seen in recent years is the explosion of containers especially Kubernetes. If you are not aware of containers in 2019, you are definitely behind many in the technology field. How does a senior technical leader get deep enough to know the benefits of such a technology and when to apply them is a constant theme in my career. I decided in 2018 to shift gears in terms of my focus and spend more effort writing code during the year and not wait for the holidays. I wanted to focus on leveraging the latest technologies with the goal of expanding my knowledge base and to remain relevant in today’s economy. While I always considered myself apprised of the latest tech trends and could articulate the benefits of technology choices and architectures pretty well, I felt that I could do more. Since I think there are many others in this space that are looking for ways to remain relevant and to understand what others in the tech industry are doing to stay current, I wrote my perspective on the past year as it relates to my career and technology.

https://medium.com/swlh/a-3-step-guide-to-assess-any-business-use-case-of-ai-9111b2e233f6?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,A 3 step guide to assess any business use-case of AI,"This story is published inThe Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.","Uday Marepalli Follow The Startup -- 2 Listen Share If anyone asks me what I learnt by starting off my career working in a venture capital firm, my first reply would be to mention that it was the unique pleasure of being a generalist in a world that expects recent college graduates to work on specific areas. On deeper thought, it is the only industry which gives you a chance to evaluate ideas and trends. I refer to it as ‘opportunity spotting’. Or a perch to look at what the future holds. When every entrepreneur you meet and every report you study speaks about AI, you tend to keep a close tab on it. When I moved to a venture backed AI computing startup (Series C), it was this skillset of opportunity spotting that I took along. Performing a deep dive on multiple industries, identifying use-cases of AI adoption and figuring out market entry points was an extension of what I learnt in VC. I lost no time in applying the same principles and mental frameworks. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. At Columbia, I took quantitative courses centered around ML to get a feel of the implementation part of adopting AI solutions. It was my first exposure to Python, a language which The Economist hasreferredto as the world’s most popular coding language and the lingua franca of most people working in AI/ data science. In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. A commonly used phrase (cliche?) by managers is to take a ‘30,000 ft. view’ towards building a business. As a young professional interested in technology businesses, I was so caught up in trying to hone that skill that I didn’t realize that my interest area required a different approach. However, getting hands-on with the execution side of ML via coursework, couple of MOOCs’, projects involving client delivery and a lot of reading has led me to the conclusion that the traditional way of evaluating opportunities in the AI space is incomplete at best and rudimentary at worst. Here’s a 3 step framework that I now use. “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.” “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.” W. Edwards Deming has been described as the national folk hero of Japan for reviving its industry after World War II. Hisintroductioncontains a lot of adjectives but going by his above quote, we must add ‘prescient’ to that. A course work project involving logistic regression and decision trees took a team of 3 around 20+ hours to group publicly available data across years, figure out what we could actually do with the dataset collected, understand factors that could help us predict the output and decide on the combination of factors that we were going to use. It probably took us around 20% of that time to build the model and draw conclusions. Over the last quarter of 2018, our project team has consulted with a global market-intelligence firm and a NASDAQ listed ad-tech company. We are using deep learning/data analytics to solve business process challenges. For an automatic keyword extraction project with multiple types of articles, our ideal approach would have been to draw from deep key phrase extraction research being done by pioneers in the NLP world. But when we received data from our client, we realized that the annotated data would not suffice to build a traditional deep learning based model. We are now back to the table to research on statistical methods/manual annotations to work through it. To really understand what it takes to build AI/ML powered solutions, you need to work with your first dataset. Either for a course project or a deployment ready solution, major tasks of AI require practitioners to train algorithms with vast amounts of data. It takes disproportionate time to collect, clean and organize such data when compared to working on algorithms. Many industry professionals are voicing the opinion that it is actuallydatasets and not algorithmsthat drive breakthroughs. Looking at solutions being implemented in the industry from a competitive analysis perspective without thinking through what datasets gave a certain company a competitive advantage, what partnerships opened up access and an estimation of the underlying approach might just prove to be redundant when your team works on putting a roadmap in place. If you are on the business side, any tangible recommendation slide should have a section detailing what the organization’s approach towards obtaining/handling data should be. As arecovering VC industry professional, I still love the concept of a business moat (and the word keeps cropping up in my blog too!). When I had to research on AI adoption across industries, my first move was to understand how companies across the world were using AI today. But then, you can’t see what is most in vogue today and put your eggs in that basket. You need to have an inkling of what tomorrow brings. To account for this, we tracked sub-areas where there were growing VC investments. However, in hindsight, this might not have been a complete solution. This was my traditional ‘opportunity spotting’ tendency kicking into full force. Once you take a peek at the implementation part of it, you realize the dizzying pace of research and wide set of solutions that exist to solve business needs. Take the case ofimage recognitionfor example. Cloud hosted AI/ML platforms of the kind of Google Vision/ Amazon Rekognition/Clarifai have made it easier for face recognition, detecting objects, text detection, logos/landmark detection. Then there are other solutions like OpenCV which bundle a host of algorithms for the same. These plug and play kind of platforms have largely reduced the need for firm to hire vision engineers for low-hanging use cases. But globally, computer vision is ahot spacewith billions of dollars of venture money flowing into this area with the Chinese startup SenseTime aloneraising $1.2 billion. Different business use-cases require algorithms with varying levels of sophistication. Different levels of sophistication motivates companies to push the barriers of what was previously possible. There is no single number than can capture the size of the opportunity just like there is no single one algorithm-fits all approach. There’s another point here. Annual business review meetings have a 3–5 year strategic plan. But several factors have contributed to an explosion of AI research and we see a changing definition of state of the art, sometimes in as short intervals as a year. Sample this. Let us take a look at underlying infrastructure to look at the ‘velocity’ of progress. In a year and a half, the time required to train a network to classify images from the famous ImageNet corpus has fallen from one hour to about 4 minutes. TheAI indexreport mentions that this has been possible due to both algorithmic innovation and better infrastructure. Now, imagine the cascading impact on other areas across training and inference at the cloud or at the edge due to these advancements. Side Note: Recommend reading theAI Index report (2018). It is authored by professionals/ subject matter experts from Open AI and a host of other universities led by Stanford and is an authoritative text summarizing key happenings.So, the idea of a business moat is not long term in nature but a temporary advantage as the times they are a-changin. From a strategy perspective, it is important to think of ways to sustain it and this usually comes from progress on the quantitative side (combining hardware-software engineering/ data science etc. here). This brings me to the final step. “Content without method leads to fantasy; method without content to empty sophistry.” “Content without method leads to fantasy; method without content to empty sophistry.” I was interviewing for a Product Internship role (Machine Learning focus) at a major real-estate tech company (B2C) when I had the opportunity to ask my interviewer a question towards the end. “How do you incorporate/evaluate product ideas your data science team comes up with in your roadmap?” “Oh! That tends to happen a lot. We usually…………… .” It is natural to assume that product vision is set by the business team. In industries like semiconductors etc. where product roadmap is set in stone, this might be true. But when it comes to AI, this logic is flawed. In fast-changing fields, the quantitative guys are at the forefront of innovation. At a 30,000 ft view (can’t resist!), most of the current advancements we are seeing in cutting edge research around deep learning/ vision have been initiated byone researcher’s untiring efforts. Jeff Dean from Google, John Giannandrea from Apple, Ilya Sutskever from Open AI, Yann Le Cunn from Facebook have all been part of multiple business units commercializing products worth $billions and none of them have taken a business school course ever. The line between engineering and business professionals will be a blurred one in any AI related application. The researchers at the AI computing firm had unique insights on what differentiated a particular algorithm for a particular use case. At the executive level, it was the Software Head who took a keen interest in understanding if there was a primary use-case/product fit. This point of seeking out advice from quantitative team members was drilled into me when working on projects at Columbia. A call with a data scientist from the market intelligence firm gave us more insights than 3 meetings with the business analyst responsible for project delivery. We were focusing on accuracy of the classification instead of improving our recall value. It is a ratio change when you are on the business side but an whole change in approach for the data scientist on our team. 30,000 ft. views (one last time!) usually looks at business strategies from the top. Equivalent to the train-test considerations (bias/ variance), my experience has been that the unless you involve your data scientists/ engineers in Strategy sessions, there is every chance that you might be on the receiving end of untoward surprises during the implementation phase. That’s probably why most companies arelocked in a talent warto hire AI talent. The opportunity cost of not doing so is a real business threat. “We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years. It does slow things down.” “We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years. It does slow things down.” As I delve deeper into topics around AI/ML that would help me better communicate with engineering/data science teams, I see a lot of ads related to picking up AI/ML skills on my social media feeds. They mostly follow a template indicating a statistic related to AI adoption by businesses and a course that will help you pick up concepts. The duration varies from anywhere between 6 days to 6 months depending on usually two sets of target audience — business professionals in case of the former and college students for the latter. I am not sure if a 6 day course has enough of depth to cover the basic difference between classification and clustering algorithms or explain what constitutes statistics vs ML vs AI. However, if you are a business professional fascinated by this space, I think there is a better way to understand the true implications of it. One that will aid you better in building strategy. Try finding a dataset in the area you work in and use one of the zillion tutorials available online to build a rudimentary model after thinking through what you want to achieve. Now check the progress in that particular and think about how your solution can maintain a sustained lead over that of your competitor’s. Think ‘velocity’ over ‘speed’. And in case you are stuck or need to validate your thoughts, just request a data-scientist/ AI engineer in your company for a coffee meeting. :) I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Management Science at Columbia University, New York.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/8-predictions-on-social-media-marketing-in-2019-7c227a78e6ce?source=tag_archive---------120-----------------------,8 Social Media Marketing Predictions for 2019,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Rachael Bassey Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share The changing dynamics of social media marketing trends annually are deep and profound. With 3.196 billion social media users globally, according to the Global Digital Report 2018 and an avalanche of new social media platforms being churned out daily, it is no surprise, the average person in the world spends 2 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, that is, one out of every three minutes spent online. While the attention span of today’s users dropped to 8 seconds in 2018, it is crucial for brands to build their social media marketing plans/goals for the new year with this in mind. Without further ado, here are my social media marketing predictions for 2019: 1) Artificial Intelligence: It is estimated that the Compound Annual Growth Rate of AI’s adoption in the social media industry will be over 30% by 2023. AI solutions consists of technologies collaborating to find connections within enormous data sets (synonymously known as Big Data). As it pertains to social media marketing, current AI tools are highly valuable for content creation, strategic planning and reporting. Chat bots and virtual assistants have become increasingly ubiquitous, but this is only the beginning. In the future, chat bots will use “colloquial APIs” to respond to customers queries in a more human-like form. Currently, the automated service revolution has become prevalent in e-commerce sites and on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger. Social media marketers who become bullish about AI and Machine learning tools in 2019 will certainly have a competitive advantage as the demand for personalized experiences will continue to grow amongst customers. 2) Geo-location videos: Undoubtedly, location plays a vital role in how videos are discovered by individuals. With interesting developments taking over the industry like the Live Location feature of Facebook Messenger, Director Mix of YouTube; the room for brands to deliver thousands of localized videos in one campaign using Google Maps data is exciting. Thus, with precise location and robust metadata, marketers will be able to deliver more relevant content in 2019. 3) Visuals are taking over: videos convey more in sight, sound and feeling(s) than words or pictures alone. Videos on social media have grown exponentially in recent years. Between 2016 and 2017, views of branded video content increased by 99% on YouTube and 258% on Facebook; A video tweet is 6x more likely to be retweeted than a photo Tweet. As such, two vital developments for 2019 stand out: ● Visual search: In the words of Pinterest’s CEO Ben Silbermann “the future of search will be about pictures rather than keywords.” Visual search technology is being integrated into branded apps and websites as well as an augmented visual search functionality being built into channels such as Pinterest, Bing, and Google. This will be carried on to 2019 with 27 percent of all searches across 10 major platforms being for images. The time effectiveness and convenience this technology offers makes it particularly exciting for ecommerce retailers. ● Vertical videos: For decades, ‘horizontal’ or landscape videos have been the norm. However, vertical videos are leading the way today as they’ve been adopted across all major channels particularly because they are better for mobile viewers. According to Facebook Business, 65% of consumers consider brands that advertise with vertical video ‘more innovative’ and 79% of ‘novice video consumers’ prefer the vertical format and consider it more engaging. We see more brands using this functionality in 2019 to appeal to the taste of their users. 4) Transparency and security: In 2018, the world witnessed the enforcement of GDPR in the European Union. Due to the high security risk of social media in regards to data leaks and misinformation, people have become extra cautious in a bid to protect their privacy, this sensitivity is not going to end with 2018 or anytime soon. To earn and maintain users trust, measures to protect their data and privacy must be put in place. Be open and sincere with users about data privacy and utilization and how they can discard their information permanently. 5) Live streaming: According to a survey by vimeo conducted with New York Magazine, it reports that 80% of respondents would rather watch live videos from a brand than read a blog, and 82% prefer live videos from a brand to social posts. This is expected to become more widely used in 2019 for social media marketing campaigns as online viewers are thrilled by the buzz, connection and urgency of live videos. Undeniably, they create active engagement due to their real time experience and authenticity. 6) Augmented Reality (AR): With Facebook partnering with over 700 brands to achieve the companies AR vision, we can only expect to see more of this technology in 2019. The partnership entails developing an upgraded advertising platform driven by AR technology. AR-based adverts on social media have better appeal and a wider reach due to its dynamic and versatile nature. It encourages interactive UX for brands and exponentially grows conversion rates across their social media channels. 7) Influencer marketing: Influencer marketing focused majorly in connecting brands and influencers at its early stage. However, a new report from Business Insider Intelligence estimates Influencer marketing reaching between $5 billion and $10 billion in 2022. Influencers tend to have higher user engagement than content generated by brands and this will grow even more with the buzz of videos and stories. However, in the new year, we expect to see brands go the Amazon route in managing influencers regardless of the pay before service rule. 8) Gamification: Integrating the “fascinating and irresistible” characteristics of games into non-game contexts will be adopted vastly in 2019 to impact the virality of social media campaigns. This will make significant impact in the industry as it encourages conversations with users, brand loyalty and content engagement. We expect to see a further rise in gaming hybrid apps and customized marketing driven by gamification. In conclusion, 2019 will be about personalization, improved customer experience, automation and AI powered technology. It is important to stay ahead of the curve.",Rachael Bassey,https://medium.com/@rachael.u.bassey?source=post_page---byline--7c227a78e6ce---------------------------------------,0,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg,2019-01-17T02:23:16.689Z,Medium

This rapid rise of technology enabled new entrants have challenged hotels to compete. While some hotels have tightened their belts and focused on competing on price, others have seen this as an opportunity to differentiate themselves and focus on the guest experience. Many consumers believe that a better experience is worth the extra dollars. But how can you improve your current offering to guests? While there still opportunities on offering justpremium versions of the basic essentials, there are plenty of opportunities to incorporate technology to enable a better guest experience and operational efficiency for the hotel operators. Alexa, The Hotel Concierge More Alexa devices are being added to hotels for the advantage of offering guests music selections and automated wake up alarms. The hotel industry is getting to a critical mass of Alexa integrations where software offerings are beginning to pop up.This skill offers a complete automated hotel concierge.Don’t know the wifi password? just ask Alexa. Need a resturaunt recommendation close by? just ask Alexa. Check out and close out the bill without the line? yes please. Smart Mirrors Intelligent mirrors are beginning to be marketed to the US consumer market and offering weather information and more. Some of these startups likeMirrorCacheis approaching the hospitality industry to offer room service options, temperature control, and a in room concierge. The convenience of accessing a concierge will continue to be a trend and multiple startups are beginning to enter this market. Robot Housekeeping? An interesting startup,Maidbot, is taking the idea of Roomba to the hospitality industry. This can be an interesting solution to offer a cleaner room while reducing one of the highest variable costs facing hotel operators. In the future, the technology will continue to improve to offer on demand cleaning and tracking of what rooms have been cleaned. Digital Toilets Visitors to hotels in Asia usually comment to friends on the cool toilet technology they found abroad. The innovations at Toto with a heated seat and bidet have been an excellent luxury experience to guests. New startups like where I’m working at,Shine, are expanding this experience with cost saving features for hotel operators such as self cleaning and remote leak detection. This is an opportunity for guests to experience a luxury not found in AirBnbs and for hotel operators to save money What innovations do you see impacting the hotel industry in the next 5 years?",Chris Herbert,,11,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*qF7yWtblTFWp3_ib.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*qF7yWtblTFWp3_ib.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*qF7yWtblTFWp3_ib.jpeg,2019-01-02T17:43:34.997Z,Medium

Huddle was created to empower you with complete control over your digital activity and identity! My name’sQuintin, co-founder of Huddle. I love trying to understand people and designing amazing experiences for them. I’ve accrued an expansive skillset, but a developer I am not. I joined a Slack group named Maker’s Kitchen: a community where makers, builders and developers come together to create and support one another. I noticed a post from a talented developer namedBryce, introducing himself as excited to join the community and open to collaboration. I was reminded of this: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.— Michael Scott You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. — Michael Scott So, channeling my inner Steph Curry, I sent Bryce a DM. I didn’t have a particular idea in mind, but I wanted to get the conversation going. One thing led to another and here we are, a unique balance of skills and personality that make a co-founder relationship strong. To complete the recipe, sprinkle in a disdain for the structure and management of current social networks along with a passion for blockchain decentralization. We knew: it was time to change the online social experience. Social media is a valuable tool that keeps us globally connected. It’s what allowed us to meet even though we live in completely different states. That’s awesome! Although, social networks just weren’t cutting it for us. We saw huge problems that needed to be fixed with not just new code, but a freshly designed user experience. We were fed up with companies that: Track:Accessing messages, tracking your activity, knowing your location. Invasion defines the current social media relationship that exists. Mismanage:Major social media companies, like Facebook, choose to sell personal data for profit instead of advocate for private activity and communication Censor:Consolidated and centralized powers choose to alter your experience through censorship that’s based on their values, not yours Stagnate:The current social media experience is filled with endless scrolling, making it difficult to find impactful and directed discussion It was time for a change and we knew we could useBlockstackas a foundation to allow a more refined and private social experience. So we did. We created a decentralized social network focused on quality, not advertising revenue. Here’s what Huddle is all about: Private:Communicate freely knowing you can’t be monitored or censored. Secure:End-to-end encryption and client-side operation means no central servers can be hacked or breached. Quality:Curate your social experience with niche communities that promote community mindshare. Mindful:Focused group topics allow efficient and dynamic interactions. Save favored content to your library and refer to it later. Here are some features we have planned for the future of Huddle: 1 —Event Management 2 — Facebook Group Transfer 3 — Micropayment System 4 — Mobile Application Launch 5 — Product Suite 6 — Enterprise Offering Have an idea that isn’t on this list? Please send it our way — we’d absolutely love to chat with you:contact@huddle.group We strongly believe in a decentralized future where the user is empowered, privacy is a priority and community mindshare thrives. We’d love to have you in the family.Join Huddleto chat about your favorite things in public or private groups. Want to make your own? Feel free, Huddle is driven byyou.

https://medium.com/luno-money/are-cryptocurrencies-solving-todays-problems-860924d3bd2f?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,The Road to Mass Adoption: Are Cryptocurrencies Solving Today’s Problems?,"New technology can be ‘cool’, ‘interesting’ and ‘accessible’ but it doesn’t mean a market-worthy mass of people will use it","New technology can be ‘cool’, ‘interesting’ and ‘accessible’ but it doesn’t mean a market-worthy mass of people will use it Team Luno Follow Luno Publication -- 2 Listen Share Many (very sound) theories out there provide promising arguments on whichcryptocurrencyis ‘the best’. At Luno, we believe in survival of the fittest. That is to say: the cryptocurrency which fits best with the evolving human needs of our global financial system. But a few smaller ones may stick around to meet niche needs. These snowflakealtcoinsare well suited to specific uses, though they’re not right for everyone. However, when we decide which cryptocurrencies to list on Luno, one of our requirements is that they have a clear potential for mass adoption and are already showing consistent, long-term market traction. Basically, we need to be sure lots of people want to use them and will keep using them. That means that altcoins we might support have to solve a real problem. It’s often said that technology adoption follows a bell curve with defined stages as different people start catching on. It usually begins withinnovators: those on the cutting edge of technology who are in the know about brand new developments. They’re followed byearly adopters, who tend to be young, well-educated and able to take risks before the early majority move in; think hipsters, but less concerned with the price of avo-toast and more concerned with technological advancements. Although slightly more risk-averse, these people are nonetheless open-minded and susceptible to the influence ofearly adopters. Next, come the more scepticallate majority, then the ‘laggards.’ By this point, mass adoption has probably been achieved within the relevant market. Mass adoption is the point where atechnologyis thoroughly embedded and integrated into our lives, making it almost impossible to avoid. Mass adoption is the point where atechnologyis thoroughly embedded and integrated into our lives, making it almost impossible to avoid. It’s at this point where it’s ubiquitous and usually cheaply available. It’s usually at this point that the real (read: annoying) hipsters scorn said technology in favour of some long-gone nostalgia. The entrepreneurial spirit is often about ‘scratching your own itch’ or meeting your own needs. But it’s not enough for it to solve one person’s problems. For a new technology (any technology, not just cryptocurrencies) to gain widespread adoption and market traction, it needs to have a clear and unique use-case which solves a problem for a large number of people. For a new technology (any technology, not just cryptocurrencies) to gain widespread adoption and market traction, it needs to have a clear and unique use-case which solves a problem for a large number of people. For example, telephones achieved mass adoption because everyone needs to communicate with each other, and they’re far more efficient than older methods like sending physical mail. Combine that need with low cost, easy-to-use technology and phones were able to take over the world. It also needs to be a pressing issue, rather than an excuse to use the Blockchain when it’s not even necessary, or people won’t be willing to adopt it widely. Humans are creatures of habit and we won’t change those habits without a strong enough incentive. Humans are creatures of habit and we won’t change those habits without a strong enough incentive. Just look at our incessant need to keep watching Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson movies. Unless a cryptocurrency can save a lot of time and money, or have some other tangible form of utility, people are unlikely to go to the effort of adopting it. After all, learning about a new cryptocurrency and how to use, spend, and store it, is a lot of work. Seeing as so many new altcoins are launched every single day, any particular project faces fierce competition and needs to truly stand out from the crowd to get noticed by more than a handful of people. Many altcoins are simply an excuse to benefit from the hype surrounding anything using Blockchain technology and aren’t truly needed. Many altcoins are simply an excuse to benefit from the hype surrounding anything using Blockchain technology and aren’t truly needed. There’s still much to do and plenty to simplify. There’s currently one too many geeky terms being thrown around and too much emphasis onhowthe technology works. Granted, it is a new technology and it is important to attract brilliant minds to help build the infrastructure, but the end user doesn’t need to know about the hash rate or side chains. Take the internet for example, doyouknow how it works? Let’s face it: Poor usability and interfaces overwrought with intricate complexities of ‘the blockchain’ are only deterring people from adopting it. For cryptocurrencies to reach mass adoption, there are additional requirements. There needs to be easy access to objective education to help people learn about it. The price of the currency can’t be too volatile or it will be difficult for people to use it. Plus, the network itself has to scale well and handle an influx of users. More importantly, it needs to be easy to use. Unfortunately, it looks like high school never ends. Unfortunately, it looks like high school never ends. Not truly, because only the most popular altcoins are likely to flourish in their environments. It’s simply not enough to be ‘a little better’. An altcoin needs to hold relevance for a large number of people. It needs to solve a problem which doesn’t already have a working solution. An altcoin needs to hold relevance for a large number of people. It needs to solve a problem which doesn’t already have a working solution. And, in a glorious script-flip, Bitcoin nerds are the popular ones at Real Life High School. In this industry community is everything. Bitcoinmight not be the best cryptocurrency if we look at objective measures like speed, cost, and user-friendliness. But, being the first, it has a substantial surrounding community of crypto-geeks who believe in it. That means stronger surrounding infrastructure. More awareness. More developers working to improve the software. More revisions and updates. More media coverage. More trust and stability. More motivation for regulators to take a sensible approach. More high-fives in the corridor on the way to the next class. That means stronger surrounding infrastructure. More awareness. More developers working to improve the software. More revisions and updates. More media coverage. More trust and stability. More motivation for regulators to take a sensible approach. More high-fives in the corridor on the way to the next class. It would take a lot for any new altcoins to usurp that advantage built up over a decade. So while we’re always open to adding new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin arguably has the strongest shot at mass adoption.In one recent survey, 43% of people viewed Bitcoin as most likely to gain broad adoption, and 17% said the same aboutEthereum. Earlier this year, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin clarified his stance that easy access is essential for adoption, more so than other initiatives: “I think there’s too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” “I think there’s too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” This is a crucial point — a cryptocurrency needs to be easy to use and understand to have a shot at mass adoption. Essentially we’re not looking to be dazzled by brilliance or baffled by bull; we just want cryptocurrencies that work. ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are facing their moment of reckoning as the hype dies down and reality kicks in. November 2018funding totalled just 65 million USD, compared to an average of three billion USD per month during the first quarter of 2018.At least twelve ICOsthat raised over 50 million USD have yet to release anything and with a market awash in ICO tokens, they’re unlikely to meet much success if they do. Others are facing legal action for disguising securities as tokens. So it seems that most arenotsolving real problems. We know it might be frustrating if Luno doesn’t support your favourite altcoin, but it’s a decision we’ve made to protect our customers. Our customers rely on us to be the safest and easiest way to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. So we don’t want to devote too many resources to projects that don’t support that goal. In addition to requiring the potential for mass adoption, any coin we list needs to bedecentralised, secure, backed by a trustworthy team, and wanted by enough of our customers.

Disruptive technologies and a fear of the unknown is making it increasingly difficult for even the most progressive leaders and their organisations, to thrive. With less and less time to think more innovatively, those expected to lead are struggling to sustain productivity, performance and relevance — both personally and collectively. A curious mindset however, offers leaders a new outlook. An optimistic one. OUR ECONOMY IN MOTION Catalysed by the rise of automation, a new economic era is emerging. In the past, we have given names to economies based on the main skills or attributes needed to sustain economic growth. For example, the Industrial Age was mainly sustained by machines and more recently the Knowledge Economy was powered by the use of human knowledge to create technology and new systems. Now with disruptive technologies on the rise, we are questioning the role of the human in the workforce, furthermore how industry will need to shift for humans to thrive in this emergent economy — the Human led Economy. The key to organisations successfully making the transition to the Human led Economy will be in how well they instil a mindset of curiosity, how well the…",Lucy Hackshaw,https://medium.com/@contact_42623?source=post_page---byline--8e392c536680---------------------------------------,76,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg,2019-02-27T23:00:20.407Z,Medium

We are motivated. We are thirsty for success, especially in our business life. However, as we already know, it is no easy task to start and grow a company from scratch, there are many ways in which we could screw up and fail. Yes, fail. And no matter what most motivational speakers and business gurus tell you about the goodness of failing, at the end of the day it still sucks! Today I present to you the 10 most common reasons why tech startups fail, so you are aware and you can do something about it before it’s too late. Vanity metrics do nothing for your actual website objectives, but make your marketing efforts look good.Jason Amunwa Vanity metrics do nothing for your actual website objectives, but make your marketing efforts look good. Jason Amunwa Sometimes founders find themselves tracking and measuring benchmarks that are not necessarily important to the company, meaning that they’re not directly related to its success (whatever their specific definition of success is). These are called Vanity Metrics, and even though they make you feel good about your business, they’re terrible for taking action. For example, tracking likes, number of followers and users instead of things like downloads, purchases, churn rate and retention rates, etc., are more about feeling good rather than planning effectively. Vanity metrics are self-sabotaging and they’re named that way because many founders feel good with the delusion of a thriving business based on these metrics, instead of facing the cold hard truth. Here’s a quick comparative list of vanity metrics versus the truly useful engament metrics. Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do.John Carmack Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do. John Carmack There was a little company called Burbn, a platform for checking in places, reviewing the spots and also uploading pictures every now and then. Long story short, their initial model did not go as planned and they decided to focus on one thing: uploading pictures. So, Burbn grew some more and now it is a more or less known app called Instagram. Moral of the story? Do not name your startup after a spirit. Just joking, the moral is that focusing on one single thing and being the best at that one thing, will most likely boost you rather than detract you. Heinz, the ketchup company, can also confirm. In YC’s case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups.Sam Altman In YC’s case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. Sam Altman Team is key, people. A great product with a poor team will most likely burn down. While a great team with a poor product might find the way around. They pivot, they test, and most importantlythey keep trying. There are many things that could go wrong with a weak team. Mainly, giving up too easily, co-founder conflicts and poor leadership. When things get ugly (and they will), co-founders usually have conflicts. If you and your team are not able to withstand those issues and push through, it will, most likely, fail. When things get ugly, most people do not have the gut and courage to keep going and they give up too easily. Finally, as a founder and leader you have to show your collaborators and employees that things will get better. If you display weakness and lack of confidence, they won’t feel safe either. A team that doesn’t believe in their leader always result in chaos. The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing.Joshua Harris The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing. Joshua Harris Bad timing is also a well-known startup murderer. Some real-life examples include Myspace and Friendster. Most people believe being too late in a market is the only timing issue a company can face. However, being mistimed means being either too early or too late for the market. Here are some over-early companies:1. Webvan: Today Conershop/Instacart2. Pets.com: Today Petflow.com3. Letsbuyit.com: Today Groupon4. Beenz.com: Today Cryptocurrencies5. Justin.tv: Today Periscope Great timing is hard to predict, and there need to bemany variablesin place in order to successfully launch a startup. The pre-existence of enabling technologies, optimal economic conditions, and trends and cultural acceptance are key factors for founders to take into consideration. In his Ted Talk, Bill Gross explains why bad timing is the single most important reason for startup failure. I might not think it’s the number one reason, but certainly one of the most important. If you build it…you may still need Google AdWords.Jennifer Mesenbrink If you build it…you may still need Google AdWords. Jennifer Mesenbrink Straight to the point. Poor marketing is as bad as a bad product, if not worse. I’ve seen bad products with great marketing develop traction, but rarely gets a good product with bad marketing even noticed. Also, spending huge amounts of money in marketing just for the sake of doing so, with no real specific strategy and measurable goals can kill the company itself. This is closely related to point 2 (below). Get rich or die tryin’.50 Cent Get rich or die tryin’. 50 Cent Okay, I didn’t find any ad-hoc quote, but I like 50. Many times, the product is good, the marketing is great and the team is amazing. But many times, the product itself isn’t able to find a proper way to monetize its services. This is the problem many freemium services and media companies face. Peopleusetheir products, but they’re not willing to pay for them. Also, there are companies whose monetization strategy started way too late and failed to implement it later on. Napster is a clear example. Even though there were80 million usersusing the music sharing platform at the top of their game. They failed to implement a SaaS business model later on, after copyrights lawsuits started flooding the company.

Brad Hargreaves Just like burn rates, this could be very much improved if only founders were a little bit self-aware. If your business does not make sense in unit terms, it will not be scalable in the long run. You need to know your margins, your cost structure, your LTV/CAC ratio and your revenue streams. If you do your calculations on a “per unit” basis, and it still doesn’t make sense, they do not seem realistic, or the outcome isn’t profitable, then no matter how many customers you reach and how many downloads you get, it will not be a business but a very costly hobby.

Peter Thiel Peter Thiel has a very fatalistic perspective on competition. He believes than only companies that make it to “monopoly” status will be successful in the long run. I do not agree. Entirely. For me, competition is healthy, but it is also responsible for the death of millions of companies. Capitalism is a wild animal, and it doesn’t really care about anything other than supply and demand. Only the fittest will survive, and at the end of the day, consumers are the ones who decide that. Be clear about your vision and make sure to display that as an unhidden competitive advantage. Ask yourself honestly and consciously: Why would someone buy my product instead of the other options? Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.Tim O’Reilly Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations. Tim O’Reilly Yes, money is not the ultimate goal. It should not be. But that doesn’t mean you don’t need money. It is a means to an end, and it is not just helpful, but necessary. Most founders are very aware of this, but it is worth reassuring. Companies with suboptimal burn rates, and not enough sales to bootstrap their operations often find themselves sinking after their initial investment gets consumed. That is why it is crucial to always be aware of what your monthly expenditure is and to start planning the fundraising before running out of cash in the bank.

The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit and after product/market fit.Marc Andreessen The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit and after product/market fit. Marc Andreessen Painful. Painful stuff. What is worse than falling in love with a girl, buying her gifts and flowers, setting up dates and trying to make that person love you, just to find out she is not interested in you? Yeah, it sucks. But it is not nearly as bad as falling in love with an idea, developing the product, investing in marketing and ultimately finding out, people don’t care about it. Ouch! Many times, people let themselves go based on the sexiness of an idea, instead of actually realizing people have a need. Interestingly enough, sometimes the least sexy startups are the ones that have the biggest market opportunities. Perhaps because few people are willing to venture into that market? On the bright side, I can almost guarantee that no entrepreneur that has gone through this issue is going to make the same mistake again. Identify whether the market has a need and find a solution for it. Not the other way around. Failure is overrated. Do not aim for failure, rather try succeeding the first time and if you happen to fail, learn from it. Anyways, these 10 reasons will surely make you meditate on your new years' plans.

Oh! Good to see you.” Spiegel has got better at dealing with these encounters. Though he described himself this year as shy, the 28-year-old stands out today with his sharp dark suit, white open-collar shirt and certain kind of LA sheen. He immediately introduces me, as if the guy would care at all who I am, and asks what he is up to. Spiegel may not be quite as famous as Mark Zuckerberg — nobody has so far made a semi-fictionalised movie about him — or the founders of Google. But as America’s youngest billionaire and co-founder of Snapchat, the picture-messaging app used by 186m people every day, this is the kind of thing that tends to happen when you’re hanging around in a chicken-and-chips joint. During the course of 2018, Wall Street has fallen out of love with Spiegel. Shares in Snapchat’s parent company Snap are ending the year almost 75 per cent below their peak in February.

https://medium.com/techstream/you-probably-dont-want-a-thicker-iphone-70b6c686bac8?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,You Probably Don’t Want A Thicker iPhone,"Even if it has better battery life, a thicker phone isn’t always advantageous.","Even if it has better battery life, a thicker phone isn’t always advantageous. Isaac Young Follow Techstream -- Listen Share Ifyou’ve ever bought or seen any Apple products, you’ll know that first and foremost, they are a design company. From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook, Apple’s devices lookstunning. However, if you’ve owned an iPhone, you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like manyonline, I’ve always wondered: “Why doesn’t Apple make a thicker phone with better battery life?” “Why doesn’t Apple make a thicker phone with better battery life?” It sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals, unending battery life, and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal? The Apple product experience When Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015, it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes, but in person, the main reaction was tolook at it. “Look at it! It’s so thin, it tapers off to almost nothing!” “Look at it! It’s so thin, it tapers off to almost nothing!” If you thought that was a one-off, take a look at whatpeople were sayingabout the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros. “Yes it bends, but have you seen howthinit is?” “Yes it bends, but have you seen howthinit is?” Apple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it, so Apple wants to create a positive first impression. Apple has also built a reputation on sleek and slim devices. Since the MacBook Air, introduced in 2008, Apple has been squeezing devices as slim as possible, and people like it. The MacBook Air released to much fanfare, and sold in droves even though it was monstrously overpriced, with a $1,399 64GB SSD. This has been Apple’smodus operandifor so long that people have come to expect it, and are shocked when anything is released that doesn’t look as elegant as they expect. While often glossed over in day to day debates, “handfeel” is one of the most important things for a product that is placed predominantly in the hand. A thicker phone, even by a little bit, is noticeable when you use your phone day in day out. Of course, with their expansive R&D department, Apple knows this, so phones are made as ergonomically as possible, with thickness kept in check. Apple is so focused on ergonomics, that when originally releasing the iPhone 5 with the taller display, they set out developer guidelines for ‘safe zones’ where a right-handed user could and couldn’t touch without stretching. This kind of thoughtfulness is thrown out the window if your phone weighs 400 grammes and has the portability of a brick. The iPhone XR Problem Since the iPhone 6s, Apple has reversed their stance and started thickening their iPhones, bit by bit. The response was mostly positive up to the iPhone X, which was the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 4s. However, things changed when Apple released the iPhone XR at 8.3mm, a full 0.6mm thicker than the iPhone X. The iPhone XR was meant to be everything that people had been asking for, for almost a decade. It was cheaper than the flagship phone. It had the same performance. It had better battery life, and as a result, it was a little thicker. Aiming to please everyone, it debuted with a multitude of different colors, including the sought after Product (Red). What was not to like? But the community went bonkers over it. “It’s too thick!”, they cried. “Look on the bezels on that!” “Why is the screen so low resolution?”. These three quotes show Apple’s true market. Apple fans, no matter what they say, don’t want a thick phone with great battery life. Never before have Henry Fords words rung more true: “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!” — Henry Ford “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!” — Henry Ford The iPhone XR is a great phone. It’s everything people have been asking for, and some extra. Yes, the screen is lower resolution than the iPhone X, but if you’re looking close enough to notice the pixels, then you should check your viewing distances. The resolution doesn’tneedto improve past what Apple dubs “Retina” — There aren’t any VR headsets for iPhone, so your eyes shouldn’t be that close to the screen anyway. And yet, people refuse to buy the iPhone XR. It isn’t selling nearly as well as Apple had hoped, and the fanfare is minimal. The iPhone XR simply doesn’t have the sex appeal that past iPhones have had. This is the problem with the proposal that people have brought up for years — it simply isn’t viable for a company like Apple to produce a phonezilla with unending battery life. Conclusion If you’re in the market for an iPhone right now, I would highly recommend the iPhone XR. It’s not good looking by any means, but it has almost all the features of the iPhone XS at a fraction of the price. It has better battery life than both flagships, and will likely have better performance, thanks to it’s lower resolution screen. However, if you’re like most, your gut will tell you the iPhone XR isn’t right for you, because it probably isn’t. It doesn’t feel the same in the hand, and it doesn’t have the flagship feeling of the XS and XS Max. It isn’t the quintessential iPhone experience you’ve come to know and love. While the voice of reason is telling you to buy the XR, it won’t be the oneliving with it for 3–5 years. You will.",Isaac Young,https://medium.com/@isaacy2012?source=post_page---byline--70b6c686bac8---------------------------------------,29,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png,2021-08-21T14:45:26.436Z,Medium
https://medium.com/the-b-word/hello-world-83ed88c0b267?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,Hello World,Published inTechnically Speaking,"Brittney Ball Follow Technically Speaking -- 3 Listen Share I would first like toThank Youfor taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites. You can read the articleHERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother, as a minority, and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning, the difficulty level, and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy, punny, and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women, and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold, strong, and demands attention and that’sEVERYTHINGI want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me andHAPPY NEW YEAR!",Brittney Ball,https://me.dm/@TechnicallySpeaking,134,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg,2019-07-24T05:47:03.840Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@vernekard/the-failure-of-wechat-in-india-a-new-breed-of-chinese-entrepreneurs-6ec169ad77bc?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,The failure of Wechat in India & a new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs,Written byDinesh,"Dinesh Follow -- 1 Listen Share Factordaily did a story about how Wechat failed in India. It’s quite well written & parts of the story are contributed by my friend & former colleagueHimanshu Gupta. If you haven’t read it, you can check it out here —https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/. As someone who’s followed the evolution of chat apps & used most of them extensively, i thought i’ll offer my thoughts on the subject. A key argument in the blog is that Wechat failed to localize it’s product for the Indian market. In my view while localization plays a part in success of a platform, the bigger ideology behind the product & deeper market conditions usually lead to the success or failure of a particular product. Here by localization i mean adding/removing/modifying features or translating app text/content(Example local music in Tik-tok) or changing notation/icons(clap instead of like) not re-thinking the product for the native market & designing from ground up met to their needs specifically. When launching a new product in an existing market, the most important factor is differentiation. One simply can’t compete with the same features for the same set of users. There are 2 approaches to launching a product — launch on a smaller scale, understand the key needs & iterate(something Newsdog is also doing with multiple apps) or (if $$$ permitting) do a big bang launch to generate curiosity among your users & try to make users jump ship. Wechat when they launched in India focused on Voice notes — a feature used in China to a great extent to differentiate & the social aspect of the app. The TV campaign got them a initial set of users but maybe in the end the users didn’t use the features highlighted. The set of users who used the app was still English speakers who preferred text messaging to voice notes. Then in Nov 13, they tried the ‘all-in-one social app’ messaging. To understand why Whatsapp won where Wechat struggled one has to consider the history of the two products. Whatsapp is primarily a chat app, it helps you communicate with one another. Quickly. Wechat on the other hand was already a social network & chat system in China before coming to India. When Wechat launched in India, India already had a strong Facebook presence where we ‘added our friends’, we didn’t need another social network. And as Himanshu points out ‘’built for richer media interactions such as stickers, voice messages and video calling’ it’s product didn’t work on lower end devices in India. On the other hand Whatsapp took a different route. They had a simple philosophy — make communication seamless for everyone. This meant their biggest design principle was simplicity. They didn’t add unnecessary features keeping the product simple to use for everyone. And more importantly since the founders of Whatsapp were tech guys — they focused on improving the tech infrastructure so that it worked on various network conditions & low memory devices. At a time when SMS charges were exhorbitant, Whatsapp with it’s free messaging was just what users in India wanted. Whatsapp spread like wildfire. If you want to read more about Whatsapp’s design philosophy, check this blog post by Charlie Deets —https://medium.com/facebook-design/one-year-designing-at-whatsapp-c20b4c46bae6 Also Whatsapp worked on all phones from the very beginning — Nokia, Windows, Android, iOS — all of them, thus making sure you could communicate with all of your friends regardless of the device they used. Quite simply, Whatsapp was the better messaging product & all Indians cared about was messaging. Not finding users to chat with nearby or chatting with random strangers using shake. The other important player in the market decided to target younger users. Hike did a whole bunch of innovations to start with. Private chat mode, Indian stickers & ‘hide last seen’ — all directly attacked Whatsapp & were essential in getting a young user-base to shift to Hike. It’s referral program for free recharge helped it get more users in the short term. However in the end, the network effects of Whatsapp were just too powerful for Hike to survive & with the messaging application battle lost Hike increasing looked to evolve it’s app around the payments & social. Hike tried in vain with multiple TV advertising campaigns & another recharge program in a bid to boost falling usage but i suppose in the end it was too uphill a battle. In hindsight one can say Hike spread it’s bets too far & lost focus but had it worked we’ll just say they kept experimenting to win. Over time Whatsapp integrated more deeply into the users lives. We made groups to keep up with each other, we shared news & content with one another. We used Whatsapp to share photos. And to share location. And smaller businesses sent files using the app. Slowly work communication moved to Whatsapp since it was just faster & simpler than using email. Also since everyone was hooked onto Whatsapp, the replies were faster when you pinged here. So more people pinged on Whatsapp. People changed their DP to broadcast a new place they had been to or to just profess their love for selfies. Parents spied on their kids using ‘last seen’. And insecure couples fought over it. Then came the blue ticks & that took the whole game to a newer level. As Himanshu points out quite accurately, since WeChat was fighting a competitive battle with China at the time, it was less keen to invest in product changes in India. This has been the case typically with large social companies whose revenue comes to a great extent from their home markets. Facebook isn’t very keen to customize features for India nor is Snapchat keen to improve it’s tech for emerging markets. Facebook isn’t very keen to customize features for India nor is Snapchat keen to improve it’s tech for emerging markets. Only recently with Jio have multiple players woken up to the India opportunity with Google building a special Next Billion Users team to build applications specifically for India. In April 2014, Facebook started forcing users to download the messenger app to continue to chat with their friends. A master move as part of a broader unbundling effort, it led to a swift rise in the usage of messenger. A big reason for the move was Facebook recognizing that messaging was a much more sticky and frequent use-case than social networking. Having said all this, in my opinion WeChat gave up too early. If we follow the timeline, Tencent had the financial might & engineering capability to make it big difference & there was always the possibility of Whatsapp losing it’s way in the middle like Uber. Consider the music streaming market — Gaana has persisted over the years with multiple TV campaigns & product iterations to emerge as the leading player right now. Utility apps like Shareit, CleanMaster & multiple photo editors have had success in international markets for a long time. But before Bytedance did it with Tik-Tok & Bigo went big in South East Asia, taking an app built in China & expanding it across the world wasn’t something one imagined possible especially in content & social media space. Zhang Yiming’s success will inspire a newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs to dream big & explore international markets. It’s already happening with44 of top 100 appson the Indian playstore in 2018 being Chinese. So what’s changed from 2012 to now? The Chinese have gotten better at understanding the Indian market & executing on their plans. Tik-tok has tied up with Avneet Kaur, Jannat Zubair(plays Pankti in Tu Aashiqui Hai)- young faces of Indian television it’s audience identifies with to promote their product & people who have a higher engagement with their users than a Katrina Kaif/Parineeti Chopra. Vigo-video has video content partnerships with Elvish Yadav & MakejokeOf — both immensely popular channels from Haryana & Kanpur respectively. They’ve opened up offices in India to engage with creators & support them. When they merged Musically with Tik-tok, they got all creators to publish a video explaining the new brand to quell the expected backlash. In short, they’re just executing better. WeChat lost because it only committed partly to winning the Indian market but the newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs are in it to win it. That’s it for now.

Policy-makers continue butting heads over plans to launch domestic messaging apps, as Iran boasts of fending off foreign cyber attacks.","Your regular update on Iranian ICT policy. Policy-makers continue butting heads over plans to launch domestic messaging apps, as Iran boasts of fending off foreign cyber attacks. James Marchant Follow Filterwatch -- Listen Share November 2018 saw continued wrangling between state policy-making bodies about the pace and direction of projects supporting the development of domestic messaging apps to supplant Telegram, with the ICT Ministry and the parliamentary ‘Cyberspace Faction’ expressing frustration at a perceived lack of progress. Also during the month of November, Iran also claimed that it has been a target of cyber attacks originated from Israel. According to Iranian officials the cyber attacks failed to leave any damage on Iranian ICT infrastructure as they were neutralised by Iranian forces. After months of anticipation, theTrump administrationunveiled new sanctions against Iran, including economic sanctions on 50 banks and their subsidiaries, Iran’s national airline, and 200 individuals and vessels in the country’s shipping industry. Iran continued to develop its response to these new sanctions (and other perceived external threats) throughout November, in the face of continuing public anxiety about falling living standards and economic uncertainty. No SCC Meetings in November No meetings of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) took place during the month of November. The SCC is required to meet everyat least once every four weeks. The last meeting took place on 22 October. In the past, Rouhani has been criticised for not holding frequent enough meetings of the SCC, although so far in his second term meetings have been held on a regular basis. Deputy ICT Minister Slams Ministries for Dragging Feet on Domestic Messaging Apps On23 Novemberrepresentatives from a number of domestic messaging apps met with Deputy ICT Minister Hamid Fatahi. In the meeting, Fatahi said that a document titled “Supporting Domestic Messaging Apps” had been passed on 1 August 2016 by the SCC and received approval from Supreme Leader Khamenei before being sent to all the appropriate ministries and organisations. According to Fatahi, the documents outlined five or six action points for the ICT Ministry but the rest of the actions was for other organisations and ministries. Although the document is not available in full for the public, it appears to be leading document in outlining the financial and infrastructural support each section of Iranian government must give to domestic messaging apps. The meeting was also attended by representatives from the messaging appsSoroush,Eitaa, andBisPhone. The conservative MP Ehsan Ghazizadeh — who recently launched the parliamentary ‘Cyberspace Faction’ — was also present. Telecommunications Infrastructure Company Budget Passed On11 NovemberGeneral Assembly of Telecommunication Infrastructure Company gathered and its members voted for the budget of the TIC for the coming year. During as well as Siroos Movaseghi, representatives from ICT Ministry, Plan and Budget organisation, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistic, and Ministry of Cooperatives, Labour, and Social Welfare. Iran Secures Post on ITU Council On5 Novemberat the ITU’s 2018 Plenipotentiary Conference in Dubai, Iran was elected to the ITU Council. It occupies one of the 13 seats in the ITU’s ‘Asia and Australasia’ region. The Council has a total of 48 seats globally. This marks an extension of Iran’s engagements in ICT diplomacy and international internet governance sphere, and will allow it to play a more influential role in global debates over global ICT regulations. According to theITU website, the Council “acts as the Union’s governing body in the interval between Plenipotentiary Conferences. Its role is to consider broad telecommunication policy issues to ensure that the Union’s activities, policies and strategies fully respond to today’s dynamic, rapidly changing telecommunications environment”. CRA Accuses IRIB of Obstructing Mobile Networks On19 November, the head of Iran’s Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA) Hossein Fallah Joshaghani stated that IRIB was an obstacle to the development of Iran’s mobile networks. He accused IRIB of refusing to free up the 700 and 800 MHz frequencies, therefore denying their use to mobile phone operators. He added that the issue has been referred to the SCC to resolve the conflict between IRIB and the ICT Ministry. Previously, IRIB and the ICT Ministry have found themselves in direct conflict over a number of other issues, such as the regulation of IPTVs. ICT Ministry Launches National Trunk Radio Network On6 Novemberduring Iran’s ‘Passive Defence Week’, Iran’s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi unveiled Iran’s “National Trunk Radio” network. The network was tested by connecting Mazandaran, Kerman and Khuzestan with locations in Greater Teheran. The Network was built after by a 17 billion IRR investment allocated to it by the cabinet and Supreme Council of National Security. According to the ICT Ministry this infrastructure will be used to manage ICT communications during times of national crisis. ICT Minister Claims Israeli Cyber Attack Thwarted On5 NovemberIran’s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi announced that Iran’s network infrastructure was the target of a cyber attack from an Israel-based company called Golden Line. Jahromi claimed that the attack was successfully neutralised by Iranian officials. He added that Iran will pursue the matter legally in International institutions. Jahromi did not specify the details of the attack, although he added that Iran’s mobile phone network infrastructure was the main target of the attack After Kermanshah Earthquake, FATA Warns of Crackdown on Misinformation On25 NovemberColonel Mohammadreza Amooyi from the Kermanshah Province Police said that the Cyber Police (FATA) has been monitoring social media for rumours and false news in the aftermath of the earthquake in the provence, and will take legal actions against those spreading rumours to disturb the peace. The 6.3-magnitude earthquake took place on Sunday24 November. In recent years, FATA has been active in warning Iranian social media users about the dangers of spreading disinformation, threatening violators with arrest and legal action. ICT Ministry Announces Citizens’ Banking and Fuel Cards Linked On26 NovemberIran’s ICT Ministry announced that bank cards are now synced with the subsidised fuel cards of Iranians. According to the ICT Ministry, this development will lead to citizens saving 3.3tn IRR (78.5m USD) per year. The development of digital services is a key pillar of the development of SHOMA, and has been heavily promoted by government ministries. ICT Ministry: ICT Sector Worth 44tn IRR to Iranian Economy in 2016–17 On14 NovemberNiloufar Morad, the Strategic Planning and Coordination Deputy from the ICT Ministry’s Office of Economic Investigations said that between March 2012 — March 2013 (or 1391 in the Iranian calendar) the ICT sector added a total of 1.41% to the Iranian economy, whereas between March 2016 — March 2017 (or 1395) this figure rose to 1.52%. According to Morad, by 1395 the ICT sector was worth 44tn IRR (10.45bn USD) to the Iranian economy. ICT Ministry Confirms Banking Services to be Moved to SHOMA On6 NovemberMohammad Sadegh Beikpour, the Head of the ICT Ministry’s Passive Defence Committee said that the committee is working to ensure that Iran’s online banking services are provided on SHOMA’s infrastructure and accessible at any situation. This appears to be a move to boost the readiness of Iran’s financial systems for crises and incidences of internet shutdowns, either caused by state authorities or external actors. ICT Ministry Denies ‘Smart Filtering’ Plans for Instagram Seyyed Jamal Hadiyan Tabayi the head of public relations at ICT Ministry on9 Novemberdismissed the claims that there are plans for “smart filtering” of Instagram. He added that ICT Ministry would be completely open with the public on these issues. Last month an official from FATA claimed there are such proposals are being considered. ”Smart Filtering” refers to a previous flagship ICT policy which sought to block access to certain Instagram pages while providing access to the rest of the site to Iranian users. The policy was previously abandoned after Instagram’s introduction of the HTTPS protocol made Iran’s filtering methods obsolete. NCC Expresses Concern Over Current Version of ‘Managing Social Messengers Bill’ On7 NovemberSaeed Mehdiyoon the Deputy for Regulation Coordination at the National Cyberspace Center said that the issues of support for domestic messaging apps and the granting further control to armed forces outlined in ‘Managing Social Messengers Bill’ must be introduced in different bills. Both policy initiatives appeared in the existing draft of the bill. It is likely that if the bill progresses to a binding vote in Parliament, ICT policy making bodies such as the National Center for Cyberspace will seek to contest it further. The current version of the bill contradicts the stated policies of the ICT Ministry and the SCC, and appears to constitute a rather ambitious push by conservative elements in the Iranian establishment to secure more influence over national ICT infrastructure and policy-making processes.

https://medium.com/@danishkho19/messaging-queue-makanan-apa-itu-832d2b2312e6?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,Messaging Queue? Makanan apa itu?,Apa ya MQ ini?,"danish jatmiko Follow -- Share Happy New Year 2019 for everyone who celebrate! Selamat datang di post pertama saya di medium. Salah satu hal yang ingin saya mulai kerjakan di tahun ini adalah untuk mulai menulis dan sharing beberapa hal yang saya ketahui melalui pengalaman dan hasil pembelajaran saya selama ini dengan sesederhana mungkin. Untuk post pertama ini saya menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia agar lebih memudahkan saja, pastinya juga karena saya sadar bahasa Inggris saya buruk XD. Mengenai topicnya sendiri, mengapaMQ(Messaging Queue)? Saya memilih topic ini karena ini adalah salah satu konsep yang palingchallenginguntuk saya pahami saat join Tokopedia pertama kalinya, dan sangat menarik untuk dipelajari terutama untuk teman-teman yang baru masuk ke dunia web engineering. Apa ya MQ ini? Sederhananya MQ adalah suatu bentuk komunikasi antarservicesecaraasynchronous.Dimana konsep ini banyak digunakan dalam dunia web yang menggunakanmicroservice architecture.Biasanya konsep ini digunakan untuk memisahkan banyak proses yang berat,batch processing, dan untuk segala sesuatu yangtidak harus diselesaikansecarasynchronous. Ada 3 komponen utama dalam sebuah konsep MQ. YaituProducer,Queue Platform, danConsumer. Produceradalah suatuserviceyang akanmembagikan/publishmessageberupa data kepadaservicelainnya. Queue Platformadalah suatuserviceyang berfungsi untuk mendistribusikan/membagikanmessageyang berasal dariProducerke setiapConsumeryang ada. Consumeradalah satu atau banyakserviceyang akan mengolah data yang diberikan olehProducermelaluiQueue Platform. Sebentar, kok dari tadi gua ga paham maksud Queue dalam MQ? Sama seperti artinya,Queueberartiantriandalam Bahasa Indonesia.Queue Platformsangat berperan dalam mewujudkan antrian data dariProducerkeConsumer.Data yang diberikan oleh produser tidak akan didistribusikan langsung keconsumernya, melainkan akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dimanaconsumerakan memproses data satu per satu sesuai dengan antrian yang ada. Contohnya, suatu saatProducermelakukanpublish1000 data dalam 1 detik, namun consumer yang ada hanya mampu memproses 10 data per 1 detik. Maka akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dari 1000 data tersebut menggunakan konsepFIFO(First In First Out). Dalam kasus ini semua data akan terselesaikan dalam waktu 100 detik. Dari contoh tersebut bisa dilihat penerapan MQ untukbatch processing.Lalu untuk sedekar informasi juga, kita bisa menggunakan 2 atau lebihconsumeruntuk memproses data yang sama. Dalam kasus di atas kita menganggap bahwa hanya ada 1 consumer, bagaimana bila kita memiliki 5 consumer untuk memproses sebuah antrian (1000 data)? dengan kecepatan 1 consumer = 10 data/detik, maka bila ada 5 consumer = 50 data/detik. 1000 data akan bisa diselesaikan dalam waktu 20 detik saja. Pusing bos, ada contoh kasusnya gak? Untuk lebih memudahkan untuk memahami konsep MQ, saya akan berikan sedikit contoh sederhana dalam penerapan MQ. Bayangkan saja anda adalah engineer akan mendevelopsebuahmarketplace online, dimana ada salah satu order yang akan di konfirmasi oleh pembeli bahwa barang telah sampai. Kira-kira proses yang akan terjadi setelah pembeli konfirmasi adalah: Update status transaksi menjadi selesai. Berikan uang pada penjual, dan potong uang pajak dll. Update status toko dan barang. Update status transaksi berhasil. Kirim notifikasi email dan sms. Tambah reputasi dan ulasan. dll. Mungkin pada saat pertama kali marketplace online andarelease, semua poin di atas tidak masalah bila dijalankan secarasynchronous. Namun bagaimana bila semakin banyakbusinessmodelyang diinginkan? Misal ingin menambah pengecekan fraud, atau notifikasi berupaWhatsapp, bahkan memberikan bonus dan promo tambahan ke pembeli? Kita perlu memikirkan kembali arsitektur kita. Dalam kasus di atas, kita bisa menggunakan konsep MQ. Producerdalam kasus ini adalahserviceyang bagian mengupdate status transaksi saja, lalu setelah itupublishdata keQueue Platform, dimana data ini akan didistribusikan keservicesconsumerbagian update status toko, barang, tambah reputasi, kirim notifikasi, promo, dll. Setiap consumer akan memproses data yang diterima masing-masing tanpa mengganggu consumer lainnya. Update status transaksi menjadi selesai merupakan prosessynchronousyang tak dapat dihindari, namun untuk mengirim email, notifikasi, update status toko, tambah reputasi, berikan uang kepada penjual merupakan proses yang tidak harus saat itu juga berhasil, atau dalam artian lain masih bisa dimaklumi bila terjadi sedikit delay. Dengan hanya proses Update status transaksi yang menjadi proses utama dansynchronous,maka process time web service anda akan relatif lebih cepat daripada harus menjalankan lebih dari 10 business model sekaligus. Selain itu ini juga baik secara UX karena user tidak perlu menunggu lama. Keuntungan lainnya bosque? Menurut saya pribadi, fungsi utama dari MQ adalah kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi antar service tanpa harus berhubungan dengan langsung melalui API atau HTTP Protocol lainnya. Jadi antar service itu bisa tak saling mengenal, tapi masih mungkin berkomunikasi. Atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilahDecouple. Dalam duniamicroservices, ketergantungan antarserviceharus ditekan seminimal mungkin, tujuannya agar apabila suatuservicedown, makaserviceyang lainnya tidak perlu ikutdownjuga. Contohnya dalam kasus contoh konfirmasi buyer di atas, apabila saat ingin konfirmasi, tetapi service reputasi dan email down, apakah harusfitur konfirmasiini ikutan gagal juga? dengan adanya MQ ini, apabilaserviceemail ataupun reputasidown, data untuk kedua service ini tidak hilang, tersimpan dalam queue dan dapat diproses kembali ketika kedua service tersebut Up. Dan secara UX baik karena buyer tetap berhasil konfirmasi. Hmmm, Kayanya pernah tau konsep ini di jaman kuliah dulu, ini Observer pattern gak sih? Pada awalnya saat saya belajar MQ, saya kira ini adalahobserverpattern. Tapi setelah membaca artikelini, saya jadi sadar bahwa konsep MQ ini berbeda sekali denganObserverpattern, konsep MQ ini biasa dikenal denganpub-sub pattern. Secara sederhana perbedaan utamanya adalah, kalau dipub-sub pattern, antarapublisherdansubscriberitu tidak saling mengenal dan tidak terhubung secara langsung. Ada pihak ketiga yang berperan sebagai mediator untukpublisherdansubscribersaling berkomunikasi. Namun diObserver pattern,antaraObjectdanObservernyasudah saling mengenal terlebih dahulu dan mereka saling berkomunikasi secara langsung ketika ada suatu event. Untuk lebih jelasnya teman-teman bisa membaca artikel di linkini. Akhirnyaa…. Terima kasih teman-teman sudah meluangkan waktu untuk membaca artikel pertama saya ini. Saya tahu masih banyak kekurangan dalam artikel ini, oleh karena itu saya juga terbuka untuk saran dan kritik untuk kebaikan kita bersama. Bila ada konsep atau penjelasan saya yang kurang tepat, saya juga mohon maaf dan kita bisa diskusikan lagi di kolom komentar dibawah ya.

Drivably, the first ever machine learning platform to source, qualify, predict, and provide the right inventory for your dealership in real time. With the ability to increase profitability, and efficiently scale your internal buying channels, dealerships will time travel right back into the hay day when they actually made money on cars. Drivably analyzes millions of data points across platforms like Kelly Blue Book, NADA, Manheim, and others to under to understand what inventory belong in what markets across the US. This gives dealerships the ability to make the right decisions on what to purchase, every time. If you ask 10 “Car Dog” dealers if they made better margins on selling cars in 1998 than 2018, 10 of them will say some variation of “ABSOLUTELY”. The acquisition epidemic that dealers are being faced with today comes down to four things. Manheim’s stronghold on the wholesale market causing price hikes. The rapidly increasing number of new dealerships each year causing unrealistic values on cars. The lack of time to find and analyze information to make timely decisions. The poor experience dealers have created for private sellers making it hard to buy off private market inventory. With Drivably, dealers will now have access to new rental, fleet, and private inventory that is designed to meet their needs. Because of Drivably’s extensive relationships across these various channels, they are able to analyze hundreds of thousands of units every single day. Drivably can tell dealerships what inventory they need, regardless of where is sits in the US and due to their friendly approach to the private market, they have the ability to tap into 15 million private market units that most dealers don’t currently have access to. In an interview with Tyler Hall, the Founder and CEO of Drivably, he said.. “The days of car dealers making front-end gross on cars is temporarily over, until now. Car dealers have been conditioned to believe that the car is simply an asset that provides the opportunity for them to sell back-end product like an Extended Service Contract, or Gap Insurance. This would be like Chic-Fil-A (a company that has dominated the retail chicken market for over 70 years) selling chicken to break even, so they could upsell a drink and make a few bucks. Drivably will not only provide meaningful insights to dealers to make the best purchasing decisions, but we will take it a step further by supplying the physical inventory to their doors. This is something that has never been done before, and will completely change the modern day automotive industry as we know it.” “The days of car dealers making front-end gross on cars is temporarily over, until now.

Make sure you reach out promptly as Drivably only accepts a certain amount of dealers within any given market. This is due to our value being largely dependent on the amount of available supply within each market. Brad Harp, General Partner of a large dealer group in the East said “In the 18 years of being in the automotive industry I’ve never had a vendor claim that they could actually increase the amount of money I made selling cars. Drivably not only increased our gross profit per unit, but decreased acquisition spend by over $550,000 per year. This saved us hundreds of hours of time and enabled me to turn our focus to the customer. We have taken over this market because our customers are happier, and referral business is up by 41%. That’s really what it’s all about.” To learn more about Drivably visit our website atDrivably.com.

https://medium.com/@anudaweerasinghe/the-best-books-i-read-in-2018-1d6e0ee1f848?source=tag_archive---------124-----------------------,The Best Books I Read in 2018,15. Start with Why by Simon Sinek,"Anuda Weerasinghe Follow -- Listen Share Back when I was in elementary school, I used to read a lot. I mostly read fiction, but nevertheless I would read often. However, with the greater penetration of technology and social media into my life, my reading hobby died down to a point where it was merely a chore I did for school. Although I wasn’t reading, I still developed my passion for science and technology and improved my knowledge in these areas through sources like YouTube videos, blog posts and articles. But during the summer of 2018, I realized something: compared to YouTube videos, blog posts and articles, the quality and quantity of the content in books are at a different level. A YouTuber at most will spend a few days working on scripting, shooting and editing a video. Similarly a short blog post or article won’t take more than a few days of work. But a book takes years of planning, writing, and editing to get published. Also, whilst anyone with an internet connection can upload a YouTube video or write a blog post, a book goes through a huge amount of quality control before it’s published. After understanding the relative value of books as a medium to grow my knowledge and understanding of technology, I decided to start reading regularly again and set myself the goal of reading a book each week or 25 books before the end of 2018. By today, the 1st of January 2019, I’ve read 23/25 books, which I’m pretty happy with. Over the course of these 6 months and 23 books, I learnt a huge amount and I also feel that I have grown more as a person. Of course not all 23 books taught me a lot and had a great impact on me, but the following 15 books did. I have ordered them from least to most impactful and shared a bit of information about each book and the lessons I learnt from each of them. 15. Start with Why by Simon Sinek I picked up this book purely because I was familiar with Sinek and his idea of Starting with Why and its effect on an audience. I first watched Simon Sinek’sTed Talk, Start with Why,around the beginning of middle school, and it has shaped the structure of my writing, speaking and thinking processes. “Start with Why” builds on the idea of the golden circle that’s brought up in the Ted Talk. However, in addition to focusing on the power of “Starting with Why” as a communication tool, Sinek illustrated a variety of examples to emphasize the importance of having a why and shaping one’s day to day activities around this why. He explains that be it an organization or an individual, progress requires a clear understanding of why they get out of bed every morning. 14. Soccermatics by David Sumpter Although I’m not a big fan of soccer, I picked up this book because I am a fan of Mathematics and Data Science. In Soccermatics, David Sumpter uses a lot of match data coupled with mathematical reasoning and analysis techniques to explore the math behind various aspects of football: from formations to bicycle kicks. He also uses match data and a bit of Machine Learning to predict future match results, which he then put to the test by betting on them. Though Sumpter’s explanations were a bit boring at times, some results were quite interesting and I found it really interesting how Math can be applied to almost anything- even football. 13. Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark My interest in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has been steadily growing in the last year or so. Life 3.0, is about our future in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Tegmark explains that life on Earth has gone through three main stages — Life 1.0 represents the simple one-celled organisms like bacteria that can only survive and replicate itself, but cannot redesign its software (skills and knowledge) or hardware (physical composition); Life 2.0 represents animals like humans who can survive and replicate and also redesign and update its software (skills and knowledge) through practice and data analysis, but cannot update its hardware (physical composition); finally Life 3.0 represents the future of life, sentient computer systems or robots, that can replicate itself, redesign its software (skills and knowledge) and redesign its hardware (physical composition.) I think this a very novel way of looking at the idea of AI and it hit me quite hard. Throughout the book, Tegmark explores both the potential social, economic and political challenges and opportunities when life reaches its 3rd stage of Life 3.0. This is a great read if you’re at all interested in AI. 12. Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson Steve Jobs, Co-Founder and Former CEO of Apple Inc, has been one of the most influential personalities in the modern world. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, tells the whole story of the mega icon including his ups, downs and quirks. Reading this book, gave me a better understanding of the history of the world’s first trillion dollar organization and its successes. The book also taught me a lot about leadership through the recounts of Jobs’ unconventional leadership and management strategies. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in technology, leadership or business. 11. Outnumbered by David Sumpter Outnumbered is another book by David Sumpter that revolves around the subject of Mathematics. But this time, Sumpter focuses on more of the controversial applications of Mathematics including the algorithms that feed us information on a day to day basis. Sumpter uses data coupled with his knowledge of data science to explain and evaluate the effects of various algorithms on recent political events. He explores some of the issues we’ve seen as controversial in the last few years including fake news, and Cambridge Analytica’s impact on democratic processes. I found outnumbered much more interesting than Soccermatics, perhaps because the context was more interesting to me. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in politics, technology, data science or math. 10. The Everything Store by Brad Stone At the time of writing, Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest man with a net worth of over $150 Billion. The Everything Store tells the story of the Princeton Graduate who saw the potential of the internet in the 1990’s and leveraged it to become the richest man in the world. Today, amazon has literally become “The Everything Store” and is a common household name. Stone recounts how Amazon started off as an online bookstore rather than the everything store it is today. Some of the most interesting and surprising aspects of the Amazon story to me, was the shear force that Amazon operates with in the market to get its way and come out on top. This is a great book for aspiring entrepreneurs and anyone interested in technology or business. 9. The Four by Scott Galloway There are four organizations that play a major role in our lives : Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. These are the four most influential companies on the planet, and Scott Galloway explores the hidden DNA of these companies in this book. He explores the rise of the four and also the key characteristics that make these organizations so powerful and successful. In addition to the exploration of the four’s technology, Galloway also highlights the key operation/management techniques and HR practices exercised by the four. I’ve been following and studying these companies for quite a bit, but this book took my understanding of these organizations to a greater depth. 8. The Google Story by David A. Vise, and Mark Malseed Google is a company that greatly inspired my journey as a technology enthusiast and programmer. In this book Vise and Malseed, recount the story of how two nerdy Stanford Grad students changed the way we organize the world’s information. The book explains what makes Google such a unique organization including the culture and management strategies employed at Google. Reading this book, further inspired my entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in technology or business. 7. Now I’m Talking by Vijendran Watson Mobile Telecommunications and the power that connectivity brings to users has probably been one of the most important developments in the last few decades. Especially in the developing regions of South Asia, the mobile telecommunications industry has had a massive impact on every single individual. In his book Now I’m Talking, Vijendran Watson tells his story as a pioneer in the mobile telecommunications industry. His well composed story from a young boy to a network engineer to finally the leader of many leading telecom operators has numerous lessons for everyone. 6. Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance Despite his eccentricities, Elon Musk is one of the most successful and important entrepreneurs and technologists in the world. Like Google, Musk’s work, from Tesla, to the Boring Company, has intrigued me for quite a while. I’ve watched multiple interviews and speeches by Musk, to get a better understanding of his thinking processes and management style, but no interview went to as much depth as this book by Ashlee Vance. The book tells the story of a young boy, who transforms from a victim of bullying in South Africa to one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world. Vance highlights the challenges that Musk faced throughout his entrepreneurial journey from PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX, as well as the management strategies and work ethic that Musk demonstrates on a daily basis. This book gave me a new found respect for Elon Musk and also made me rethink my own work, people and time management skills. 5. Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki In his book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Kiyosaki highlights the difference between his two dads: his poor yet educated actual dad, and his rich investor/mentor dad. I didn’t know much about personal financial planning before I read this book, yet Robert Kiyosaki does an excellent job at simplifying the daunting task of financial planning into a few key guidelines. These guidelines are presented clearly and concisely making it easy to understand. I will probably reread this book in a few years, when I begin making my own financial decisions. Meanwhile, I think everyone should read this because the lessons are valuable to everyone. 4. Freakonomics by Stephen J. Dubner, and Steven Levitt Freakonomics is a book that investigates some novel ideas by looking through data through concepts studied in Economics. As an economics student, I found this book really interesting especially because Dubner and Levitt do a great job in their explanations and analyses. The questions that were explored in the book include, Why do Drug Dealers Live with their Moms? and What do School Teachers and Sumo Wrestlers Have in Common? Although I found the conclusions and answers to these questions enjoyable and interesting, the book made the biggest impact on my critical thinking processes. Using economics concepts to analyze unconventional situations, Freakonomics demonstrated and introduced me to an entirely new way of thinking and solving problems. 3. Factfulness by Hans Rosling Do you think the world is getting worse? Most people seem to think that the world is getting worse in terms of economic, and social development. Often, we categorize the world into the “developed world” and the “developing world” and assume that things are naturally worse in the developing world and alright in the developed world. I was one of these people too until I read Hans Rosling. Rosline uses data to disprove the conventional wisdom and show that the world is improving in almost every measurable way. He then provides a variety of tools that will help you look at the world in a more insightful and progressive way rather than the “rich world” and the “poor world.” I think everyone should read this book because it’s important to accurately understand the status quo before we can make a change and move forward. 2. American Kingpin by Nick Bilton American Kingpin was easily one of the most enjoyable books I read in 2018. The book outlines the story of the rise and fall of Ross Ulbtricht, the twenty-six year old programmer who built a billion-dollar online drug empire called the Silk Road from his bedroom. Bilton recounts the story excellently and captures the emotions of each and every moment of Ulbtricht’s life. Many of the books I read this year told the story of successful people and organizations. American Kingpin on the other hand is the story of a very talented person who went down the wrong path in his lifetime. Although reading about successes taught me a lot about how to be successful, I think reading about Ulbtricht had a greater impact on me because it highlighted the mistakes to avoid. 1. Shoe Dog by Phil Knight Nike is such a big company that everyone all over the world knows the company and its products very well. However, few people know about the origins and growth of Nike as a business. I didn’t know much about Nike or even admired the company until I read Shoe Dog. Phil Knight is the founder and current chairman of Nike, and Shoe Dog is the retelling of the riveting story behind Nike from a reseller of imported Japanese shoes to a global mega icon. The book is excellently written and includes so many lessons about being an entrepreneur and the challenges and hardships that come with it. I read this book twice in a few days and I highly recommend it to everyone. Reading a book each week has been a great learning experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is definitely not impossible, but if you’re struggling to find the time to keep up try starting slow by reading a book every two weeks or every month — you will still read more than you would have otherwise. I am going to keep reading and my goal for 2019 is to read 50 great books, so look forward to more posts like this.

These items worm their way into just about every industry you can think of, including some you may have considered safe from the threat of fake products. In the early days of co-founding a startup focusing on supply chain solutions, I spoke with people from a variety of different industries who were worried about counterfeits and diversion in their supply chains. But one industry that stuck out to me, in particular, was medical devices. It’s difficult to imagine someone is out therecounterfeiting life-saving devicesor implants, but it does happen. In fact, more than $51 million in counterfeit medicine and medical devices were seized inan Interpol operationback in September 2017. It’s extremely disconcerting to hear the devices many rely on to keep them healthy may not, in fact, have been manufactured under rigorous scrutiny, but rather in an attempt to make a quick buck. Fortunately, the industry is well aware of the issue, and new technologies are making it easier than ever for companies to thwart counterfeiters. After optimizing enterprise supply chains for several years, here’s how I’ve found blockchain can help: The implications of counterfeit medical devices are frightening. Patients who go in for hip replacements are expecting that hip to last 20 years or more. But they probably aren’t expecting to be fitted with artificial hips that are counterfeited and made of low-quality materials. If a fake implant is used, what was supposed to last them decades suddenly has a much shorter lifespan. And for devices like pacemakers, the stakes are even higher. With lives on the line, it’s necessary to have a chain of custody system that can help clean up supply chains. Without one, some of the products we trust to keep us healthy may actually have the opposite effect. For example, Boston Scientific’s use of polypropylene forgynecologic mesh implantsrecently came under scrutiny after more than 100,000 women filed lawsuits over the products. The plastic, originating from brokers in China, was deemed unsafe by experts. Yet after the supply of plastic was cut off, the company found another source in China — one that came with little visibility into the various steps in the supply chain. It’s simply unacceptable for patients and providers to be worried that the medical devices they’re using may have an unexpected effect on overall health. Tracking a medical device is simply a way of ensuring two things: it’s coming from the correct place, and, if something goes wrong, there’s no question of where it originated. Blockchain is the best way of eliminating any unknowns or questions. Say you’re following the path an artificial hip takes as it travels from the manufacturer to the hospital, where it awaits a hip replacement patient. The hip is tagged with a unique cryptographic identifier that links it to an identity on the blockchain. Each time that hip trades hands, from the supplier onward, it’s possible to register the timestamp and geolocation on the blockchain — creating an immutable record about the implant’s chain of custody. If everyone in the supply chain is registering those transfers of custody, it becomes difficult for counterfeits to enter the supply chain. They would have no identifier, and even if they did, the record on blockchain would show they had not originated from the supplier or manufacturer. Working backward through the registered COC, it would be relatively easy to find out where the counterfeits had entered the supply chain. A large part of the value of blockchain is that the data on these supply chains will persist. Right now, if a company that’s tracking chain of custody goes out of business, that data may not be there 10 years later when a class action lawsuit begins. With blockchain, you know that the information will always be there. It’s not possible for the guilty party to have the classic“shred everything” Enron momentwhen auditors come knocking. Still, the goal isn’t to persecute companies within the industry, it’s to make sure they have better records that don’t allow anything to slip through the cracks in the first place. Chain of custody isn’t a new concept, and there are already different methods that companies can use to track products. Some are digital, while others rely on physical documents. If your company is already using a COC solution, it’s still a good idea to add a blockchain backend to help with asset management. Over time, the goal is for the medical devices industry to come together in a consortium and set standards for what they expect the chain of custody to look like for medical devices and implants. And once those standards have been set, and the industry has formed a network around them, new collaborative possibilities can happen. Counterfeits may be a pervasive problem, but not one that patients and doctors should have to worry about. With a tighter supply chain, backed by blockchain COC solutions, that goal can be turned into a reality.

For Kaity Tainer (Kaity in Orbit🌎), it’s all of those things and more. While she works as a model and actress, she’s also a thrill seeker and documents her adventures for her LiveMe fans to experience with her. We talked to Katy about her early days working at a zipline course, finding a community on LiveMe, and what the future holds. The Beginning: Before LiveMe Kaity is from University Place, Washington, and based on the variety of jobs she had growing up, it seems as if she’s always been ready and willing to try new things. “For a while, I was working at a zipline [and] ropes course and also at a float therapy center,” she told LiveMe. “I had always been interested in doing more different activities, diving into modeling, skydiving, and slacklining once I turned 18.” As she was preparing to graduate from high school, a fashion photographer who had recently moved from NYC took Kaity’s senior pictures as a favor to her mom. He immediately noticed that she was a natural in front of the camera. “He suggested I talk to other photographers in the Seattle area, as apparently, he thought I posed well and more similar to a fashion model than someone having their senior photos done,” she said. Later, after moving to Los Angeles to model professionally, Kaity discovered she enjoyed acting as well. “I started doing more acting gigs as they became available and I realized how fun that can be as well compared to still photography,” she said. “It’s so much fun to meet people on set, and I have found many friendships through doing commercials and random background work.” In 2017, Kaity appeared in the rock band The Plot in You’s music video for the song “FEEL NOTHING,” which has over 4 million views on YouTube. Building a Community on LiveMe While pursuing her career in the entertainment industry, Kaity came across LiveMe and in 10 short months, she’s amassed about 109,000 followers. “I love the sense of community I’ve found by connecting and checking in with people most days,” says Katy about the community she has on the platform. “I’ve built a strong connection with many of the people that watch my show, as well as the broadcasters that I tune in to.” Kaity, who refers to her followers as “friends” rather than fans, feels humbled by the following she has on LiveMe. “I always hope they feel that my broadcast is somewhere they can come to feel safe, accepted, and appreciated,” she said. What’s Next? In addition to broadcasting on LiveMe, Kaity has a few trips and various modeling opportunities in the works, but as we spoke to her, she was preparing for next adventure: a trip to Taiwan to attend LiveMe’s second Global Gala. Kaity was unsure of what to expect but excited to meet Mary Cameron Rogers, another Los Angeles-based broadcaster. “I’m looking forward to seeing who all is here! I have no idea who is! I’m also stoked to be trekking out here with MC🌹!” We can’t wait to see where Kaity’s adventures lead her next! Want to read more interviews with LiveMe broadcasters?

https://medium.com/@urish/give-web-developers-a-code-editor-and-a-trumpet-what-happens-9e01a666313b?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,"Give Web Developers a Code Editor and a Trumpet, What Happens?",Not What I Expected: My Web-Midi Demo in This Year’s Chrome Dev Summit,"Not What I Expected: My Web-Midi Demo in This Year’s Chrome Dev Summit Uri Shaked Follow -- 1 Listen Share It all began when Ifailed to build a Trumpet Playing Robotin Geekcon. Shortly after, I was invited to present a demo at the Chrome Dev Summit, and thought this would be a great opportunity to explore a new API I always wanted to play with (literally) — Web MIDI. The result was not quite what I was expecting, as you will shortly discover. Last year, I presented theIn-Real-Life Chrome T-Rex Gamein the same event. It was a fun experience, and I learnt a whole bunch of new skills. It was, however, a huge undertaking for me — I spent a month of my life trying to make that happen, and fixed issues with the hardware and bugs in the software up to the very last moment, in the hotel room the night before the conference. I didn’t want to repeat the same experience this year, so I tried to go with a less demanding project this time. After spending some more time tinkering with the trumpet and even creatingan JavaScript and Angular powered device that would measure the air pressure, I realized I was heading exactly to the same direction as the last year — much work, high risk, very demanding project. So I sent the conference organizers an email: After explaining the situation in short, I presented them with two options: An hour later,Robert Nymanreplied: So my goal was set to provide the “Best Experience”. Challenge Accepted! I spent the next few weeks building theelectronics for the trumpet, designing a3D-printed finger mechanismfor it, and even coming up with aWeb-Audio based sound enginefor it. The project still consumed much of my time, but it also provided me with a bunch of post topics formy daily blogging challenge. Fast forward to the days before the conference. It was justafter AngularConnect, and I was travelling in the airplane to the bay area. At that time, I had all the electronics for the project ready and packed inside my luggage, but there was one missing piece — I spent so much time getting the hardware to work that I totally neglected the user interface part. I only had a simple web page that provided a piano-like interface: This was obviously not the “Best Experience” for the Chrome Dev Summit attendees. As I had WiFi in the plane, I decided to spend my 10 hours flight working on that. I started by asking myself: what would be the best user interface for the summit attendees — developers? The goal of the project was to educate developers about the Web MIDI API, so it made a lot of sense to show them the JavaScript code that powered the demo. But then I thought — why only see the code? Code editors are where most developers feel at home. I decided this would be the user interface for my demo, so the attendees will not only see the code behind it, but will also be able to tinker with it and save their modified versions. Then, by the end of the conference, I will have a gallery of user-contributed code snippets that play different tunes. Or so I thought… I spent the first few hours of the flight researching different solutions. After comparing several alternatives (such ascodemirror, which I also used fortsquery-playground), I decided to go withMonaco Editor, which is the editor from Visual Studio Code. It provides code auto completion and types checking (thanks to tight integration with TypeScript), which is essential when exploring a new API. You can try it yourself by using thesimulator version. This is a special version that simulates the Web MIDI API, so I could test the code while without a real MIDI instrument connected to my computer (obviously, playing a real trumpet while in the plane wouldn’t be practical. Or would it? 😉). A couple of hours later, the project was more or less ready, and I landed in San Francisco. It was probably the most productive flight I had so far, and surprisingly I managed to squeeze nearly 1GB of data out of the plane’s WiFi (400MB of which consumed just bynpm). You can find thecomplete source code for this project on GitHub, includingsome tricksI employed to visualize the code execution (more on that in a future post). When I got to the hotel, I quickly unpacked and started assembling the project in my hotel room: A quick dry-run revealed that despite the long journey, everything was still functional, and worked well with the editor I hacked together during the flight. Ready for the prime time! Finally, the big day has arrived! I was really curious to see whether the attendees will take on the opportunity to write some code for my demo. So I arrived early at the conference venue to set everything up: Despite having worked perfectly in the hotel, there were some issues with the getting the Raspberry Pi connected to the conference’s WiFi, but thanks to the very helpful event organizers, an Ethernet cable was provided and an hour later everything was ready. Then, came the first surprise: A MIDI Keyboard My friendLars Knudsenalso attended the conference, and as he knew about my project, he decided to surprise me and brought a MIDI keyboard 🎹. Then came the brilliant idea of creating a JavaScript code snippet that would connect the keyboard with the trumpet — You play the keyboard, get the sound out of the trumpet: and the result: MIDI All Things! But it didn’t stop there. He also “happened” to have a MIDI Saxophone (I didn’t even know such thing exists), so he connected it too, and now he could play the Saxophone and get the sound out of the trumpet: Just when I thought I have seen it all,Ruth Johnsuddenly appeared with a mysterious MIDI device and plugged it into the demo: A few minutes later, her device was controlling the trumpet, too: That was definitely an unexpected twist in a plot! But what happened with my original hypothesis? Did people actually write code to play songs? When I wrote the “Web MIDI Playground”, the code editor for my demo, I included a sample code snippet that plays a few notes, so others could use it as a starting point. Lars took the opportunity to code “Hava Nagila”, which you can listen to in theonline simulator. Next,Shmuela Jacobscoded some song her baby loves listening to: She hit “Run!” and started moving to the tune: She also told me that it was her first time writing code withasync/await, and she really liked how straight forward it was. The other attendees played her code snippet more than 50 times throughout the event! So yeah, people were actually writing code to play some music during the conference. What I didn’t anticipate was… Markus was a Swiss guy I met in Espruino forums after sharing the experience ofbringing back a fried Espruino board from the dead. After he learned about my project, he volunteered to help with manning the booth during the event. He arrived shortly after we connected the MIDI keyboard to the project: As you would expect from a seasoned developer, he immediately recognized the opportunity to create an abstraction layer, and spent the next two hours working onthis piece of code, creating an interpreter for some text-based music notation format he came up with: Markus also included the lyrics (as you can see above), and interpreter displays them on screen as the song is playing, turning the project into a trumpet-karaoke machine: The next surprise was the brainchild ofReilly Grant, a software engineer on the Chrome team. We met in the summit a year before, and this year he also volunteered to help manning the demo booth. After observing many attendees play melodies using the MIDI keyboard, he came up with a brilliant idea: He spent about an half an hour writing a “Composer” snippet, that would record whatever you played on the keyboard, and would spit out code that plays the same thing. You could then copy this code and save it in your own snippet. My original intention was to have the attendees write code to play the trumpet, but thanks to Lars’es keyboard and Reilly’s piece of code, they now had an interface where they could create the code without actually writing it. It was all abstracted away! This resulted in a bunch of new code snippets that were recorded by the attendees, such as the following: But the fun didn’t end here. Reilly, who remembermy magical battery powered smart light bulbfrom the previous year, asked me if I had it with me. Luckily, I did, so we proceeded to combine the Web MIDI code together with Web Bluetooth: Let There Be… Light! We wrote a shortpiece of codethat usesWeb Bluetoothto connect to the bulb and light it whenever you played a note. About 15 minutes later, he had this working: So now you could also make a disco light show while playing the trumpet with keyboard! When I started working on this project, I didn’t really know what to expect. Projects presented at conferences are usually watch-only or have limited ways you can interact with them (like the T-Rex game last year). This time, I gave the attendees the full power of a code editor, and I wasn’t sure where they will take it. I was really blown away by all of different ways the attendees programmed my robot and connected it to all sort of other MIDI devices, as well as created interesting abstractions on top of the code editor.

https://medium.com/@Appseecom/how-to-track-and-improve-iphone-gestures-with-heatmaps-8a2bb215a25e?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,How to Track and Improve iPhone Gestures with Heatmaps,Best Tools for Tracking User Behavior on Mobile Apps,"Appsee Follow -- Listen Share Ever since Apple swiped left on the home button andintroduced new gesturesinstead, iPhone gestures have become more important than ever for mobile app design. Every iPhone gesture means something about your user: whether they know where to tap and how to navigate, what features they’re interested in, and what frustrates them. If you could see and understand these interactions, you’d know exactly how to make your app better and which UI elements need improvement. That’s wheretouch heatmapscome in. Touch heatmaps are the mobile industry’s standard for assessing UI and the usability of iPhone gestures. They allow mobile teams to gain an in-depth understanding of user behavior at a glance: what areas users interact with most, what UI elements catch their attention first, and what causes them to quit or abandon the app. InGartner’s recent Market Guide for Web and Mobile App Analytics, they are called a “struggle detection tool”. How do mobile touch heatmaps work? Touch heatmaps collect, measure, and aggregate every touch interaction users made on each screen of the app. Then, this aggregation is displayed on each screen in the form of a visual overlay of a gradient. Areas colored in blue represent areas with low user interaction, and areas colored in red show a high level of user interaction. Here are five ways to use touch heatmaps to improve your mobile app’s iPhone gestures. Unresponsive gestures is one of the most crucial metrics for iPhone gestures and user interface. Only some touch heatmap tools can measure them. Touch heatmaps can be filtered to show you iPhone gestures that wereunresponsiveand caused user frustration, helping you understand what design flaw is causing the problem. That way you can easily address them before the number of frustrated users grows and starts affecting your reviews and retention rates. Unresponsive gestures can be a huge detriment to your app’s retention rates. They cause users to quit, kill, and ultimately abandon the app. Unresponsive gestures can happen because of a variety of factors. Sometimes users expect the app to behave in a certain way and their expectations are not met, for example they try to swipe to get to the next screen but the app screen doesn’t include such a function. Sometimes users think a certain element acts as a button when it does not. First impressions are important. They can make the difference between a first session after which theuser abandons the app, or a first session that is the first of many. Understanding the first gesture, especially on onboarding screens, can help understand what users are looking for, improve navigation, and reduce app abandonment. First gestures can elucidate your users’ natural impulses and the way they navigate and interact with your app’s features. If users’ first gestures on a certain screen are not what you expect, it may indicate a problem with the layout or buttons on that screen. It can also hint to you that users are looking for a specific feature, prompting you to highlight the features users desire most. Gesture UX can have a huge effect on your app’s conversion and retention rates. By filtering iPhone gestures on a touch heatmap to show only the last gesture on each screen, you can see what users did just before they either moved on to the next screen, or quit the app. If the most common last gesture on a specific screen is not the one you’d expect or want the user to make, that might indicate a problem with your button design, layout, CTA, or navigation. For example, in an eCommerce app, you would want users’ last gesture on the “My Cart” screen to be tapping the “pay now” button, to go to thecheckoutscreen and convert. If users are not tapping the “pay now” button as their last gesture, you might want to think about optimizing your CTA button. Are users behaving the way you intended them to behave? Without touch heatmaps, this would be a very difficult puzzle to solve. The color gradient of touch heatmaps means you can instantly recognize the most common iPhone gestures on any given screen. This function can tell you what catches users’ attention, what they expect your app to do, and what they think is the easiest way to accomplish the task they came to do. If the most common gesture isn’t what you thought it would be, this can help you improve layout and navigation. If there’s one thing mobile apps lack, it’s screen real estate. Even thoughphones are getting bigger, mobile apps need to pack quite a punch into a relatively small space, but without cramming too many elements onto it. This means that every inch and every pixel of space needs to be carefully planned, designed and optimized. Now imagine that you’re trying to cram design elements onto an already-crowded screen, when your touch heatmap tool tells you that users don’t actually need one of those elements. Suddenly, a whole section of your screen is freed up! With touch heatmaps, you can easily see areas that get less attention. Your users’ gestures provide a lot of hidden clues about your app’s usability, user interface, and iPhone gestures. The color spectrums of touch heatmaps illuminate these clues. Touch heatmaps enable you to instantly understand where users are tapping, which buttons are working best, and which parts of the interface are drawing users’ attention.

It is hard to beat Hubspot in their SEO game with blogs. It is hard to steal away market share of a multinational supermarket chain who has brick and mortar stores everywhere. That is when you playtheirgame without any innovating. To elaborate on this point, let’s go through one of the most well-known case studies ever. How to prevent ending up as a victim of a disruptive change. A generation ago, a“Kodak moment”meant something that was worth saving and savoring. Today, the term increasingly serves as a corporate bogeyman that warns executives of the need to stand up and respond when disruptive developments come to their market. Given that Kodak’s core business was selling film, it is not hard to see why the last few decades proved challenging. Cameras went digital and then disappeared into cellphones. People went from printing pictures to sharing them online. Sure, people print nostalgic books and holiday cards, but that volume pales in comparison to Kodak’s heyday. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012, exited legacy businesses and sold off its patents before re-emerging as a sharply smaller company in 2013. Once one of the most powerful companies in the world, today the company has a market capitalization of less than $1 billion. While the common belief is that the sole reason lies in myopia meaning that Kodak had a narrow-minded marketing approach and focused on only one aspect out of many possible marketing attributes. In the process ignoring the actual demand of the customer. Basically, we’re saying that Kodak completely ignored digital photography but is that realistic given they were the market leader by miles and had an army of people with 100k+ salaries whos sole job it was to think about marketing, strategy, and product? Basically, we’re saying that Kodak completely ignored digital photography. Basically, we’re saying that Kodak completely ignored digital photography. It’s a bit more complicated than that. The first prototype of the digital camera was created in 1975 by Steve Sasson, an engineer for Kodak. So they had the technology but fail to recognize its potential. Not really. Kodak invested billions to develop a range of digital cameras. Ultimately embracing simplicity and carving out a strong market position with technologies that made it easy to move pictures from cameras to computers. So did they miss the real disruption when phones became good enough to take pictures with, and people shifted from printing pictures to posting them on social media and mobile phone apps. This is where it gets interesting… Before Facebook even was a thing, Kodak acquired Ofoto in 2001 which you could use to get Kodak prints of digital pictures. Imagine if Kodak had truly embraced its historical tagline of “share memories, share life.” Perhaps it could have rebranded Ofoto as Kodak Moments (instead of EasyShare Gallery), making it the pioneer in social media where people could share pictures, personal updates, and links to news and information. In real life, unfortunately, Kodak used Ofoto to try to get more people to print digital images. It sold the site to Shutterfly as part of its bankruptcy plan for less than $25 million in April 2012. That same month Facebook paid $1 billion to acquire Instagram, the 13-employee company Kevin Systrom had co-founded 18 months earlier. Spotting something and doing something are two very different things. Doing something and doing the right thing are also two very different things. But Kodak did not make these mistakes. They had the talent, the money, and even the foresight to make the transition. Like Kodad, companies often see the disruptive forces affecting their industry They frequently divert sufficient resources to participate in emerging markets. Their failure is usually an inability to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up. Their failure is usually an inability to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up. Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online. Where they failed was in realizing that online photo sharingwasthe new business, not just a way to expand the printing business. 3 lessons you need to take away from this article. Define the business you are in today;Instead of explaining what you do, define the problem you are solving for customers. The job you are doing for them. For Kodak, that’s the difference between framing itself as a chemical film company vs. an imaging company vs. a moment-sharing company. For us, that’s the difference between framing ourselves as a digital tech company and aremoving friction to make lifeeasier company. Find the opportunities the disruption opens up;Perceived as a threat, disruption is actually a great growth opportunity. Disruption always grows markets, but it also always transforms business models.Research showsthat executives who perceive innovations as a threat are not able to adept in their response while those who see opportunities are expansive. Recognize the capabilities you need to realize these opportunities; Market leaders are usually best positioned to seize disruptiveopportunities. They have capabilities that are not easy for new entrants to replicate, such as access to markets, technologies, and capital resources. Of course, true innovation requires more than money and size to compete in new markets in new ways. Approach new growth with appropriate humility. As Ryan Holiday says: The Ego is the Enemy.

下篇,北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇,"Wes Hsu Follow Wes Conference Review -- Share 前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹上篇。 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇 SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 medium.com 今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。 對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。 除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。 最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。 當然，除了虛擬實境體驗外，單純跟參展者討論他們從事的科技領域也能帶來新鮮感。我在一個展示多音軌混音互動盤前面先是調整了幾顆球的位置，而感應器會依據位置改變節拍的頻率和節奏，隨著兩個八拍的反覆播放，可以輕易編出稍有節奏感的背景音樂。而後進了他們的展區，才發現這並不是一家音樂新創，而是北歐那斯達克(NASDAQ OMX)的上市公司，一家跨足工業解決方案、雲端儲存與數位諮詢的資通訊公司Tieto Oyj，他先介紹了赫爾辛基的能源管理服務，監控離峰與尖峰時段的電力配置，同時我們也聊到台灣近期公投的議題，因為芬蘭目前已有四座運轉中的核能發電模組，供應全國將近三成的電力需求，他也如實的說政府計畫在Olkiluoto與Hanhikivi兩地續建新的反應爐，在2025年預計提升至六成的發電總量，同時減少對於燃煤與燃氣的比重，也就是減少對於俄羅斯的能源依賴。另外我也在歐洲太空總署(European Space Agency)的攤位前遇到熱情的參展人，跟我介紹他們利用衛星監看泰國的河川流量變化，藉以預警曼谷潛在的洪水入侵，是與政府合作的一個成功案例。在全球盛名的新創論壇SLUSH，我們的科技大國當然不會缺席，參展攤位是由經濟部選出的潛力新創企業所佈展，我也跟兩家企業的參展者聊了自家的產品與服務，分別為防近視智能筆以及天晴青年旅店，前者研發一款偵測過度寫字角度與身體傾角以收回筆頭的智能筆，同時限制在低光源的環境下使用；後者是注重隱私的青年旅館，比起歐洲常見的三十床混宿房間，他們只提供雙人到六人的上下鋪房間，讓亞洲旅客安心入住。 短短的兩天要體驗所有的會場特色，我覺得我連一半都無法達成，例如官方企業媒合(Matchmaking)的線上平台，給予志工與新創與會投資客等交流機會，在SLUSH的系統內填寫自己的專業、經驗與想要工作的產業與角色，就可以瀏覽各個潛在合夥人的檔案，並直接送出會議洽談邀請，成功媒合後在會場區域(Meeting Area)就可以安排時段使用官方的小型面試空間。雖然我這次沒有嘗試這項功能，不過我的交換生志工朋友(非歐盟公民)，面試成功的例子可以讓大家當作參考，他是碩士班的資料科學家，預計在明年六月畢業，而應徵上了挪威新創的科技長位置，在撰寫畢業論文同時處理工作簽證，我也期待在近期內聽到他的更多好消息。會期的大量周邊活動(Side events)，我也因為排班時間錯過許多節目，像是台灣新創競技場(Taiwan Startup Stadium)與芬蘭的創業加速器中心Maria 01合作推出台灣芬蘭發表日的活動(Taiwan x Finland Demo Day)，讓十組新創一同交流展示服務。 前面談了那麼多的場內場外大小活動，接下來再回到志工的日常，還有如何準備這幾天的吃住等細節問題。我們排班的時間都有些許空檔可以用餐，組長會負責盒裝的簡餐，不過在志工訓練當天會拿到另外的一張餐券，在會場的二樓自助餐使用，瑞典肉丸是少不了的，還有各式沙拉吧，不過有時間效期的限制，像我拿到的是晚班的餐券，使用時間約是九點至凌晨一點。除此之外，志工休息區備有簡單的食物跟飲品，像是堅果、洋芋片、香蕉或是咖啡跟氣泡飲料等，而新奇的食物也有，如花椰菜鹹派(Broccoli quiche)。不定時也會出現棉花糖的融絲機，志工可以手作纏繞自己的粉色棉花糖。會場覓食也是一個選擇，需要大排長龍的甘草糖(Liquorice)口味冰淇淋或是碰巧遇到發放肉桂捲的與會者也都是刺激味蕾的好方式。 關於住宿的部分，主辦單位只有提供志工住宿的建議，兩個選項都是青年旅館，一是會期三日的宿舍床位，地點離會場只需要十分鐘的軌道電車，三晚大概五十歐元；二是一整周的市區青旅，搭乘同一班軌道電車需要約半小時的時間，七晚約一百八十歐元。而關於交通，包含會前訓練與會期總共三天的行程，主辦單位會提供赫爾辛基區域交通局HSL (Helsingin Seudun Liikenne)的三日交通卡，可以搭乘赫爾辛基市區的大眾運輸工具如軌道電車、火車、公車以及捷運，從會場到市區可以選擇7號軌道電車或是密集的火車直達車。如果後續的行程也需要搭乘，可以買七十二小時的三日票，十八歐元，換算下來一天搭乘超過三趟，價值就超過手機購買每張二歐二十分的電子單程票券。 會期結束後的第一天(Dec. 6th)剛好是芬蘭獨立日，也適逢赫爾辛基中央圖書館(Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi)對外開幕的第二日。 三層樓的空間擠滿了各個年齡層的家庭成員，從入口停放的嬰兒車數量就能探出端倪，頂樓的玻璃帷幕內部是藏書超過一萬本的開架室，同時包含一個小舞台與一個講座空間，當天有童書故事時間和小提琴演奏，讓小孩與小小孩自由的在舞台前或坐或躺度過午後時光。我在翻閱書籍時也發現芬蘭人對性別平等教育的重視，中央區域的書櫃有幾排貼上彩虹標籤的英文書與芬蘭文書，這樣的題材能增進讀者對己身的性別意識。二樓則是多以工作室型態，多台3D印表機與裁縫機，讓樂於手作的市民可以不受手邊缺乏工具的限制。最後，一樓不意外的是設置茶點桌椅區，在芬蘭也能體會到瑞典式的Fika咖啡文化。中午過後人數抵達參訪上限，隨即管理入口的人流，讓進出的人數平衡，同時也能看到兩個出入口都排了超過百人的隊伍，讓我有種回到家鄉的錯覺。 芬蘭人慶祝獨立日的方式很平靜，夜幕低垂的時刻，即使還不到四點，學生舉著火把從郊區墓園旁的小教堂開始遊行，一路朝著市中心前進，繞過總統官邸後，在赫爾辛基主教座堂(Helsinki Cathedral)前面聚集，唱著聖歌(Choral singing)接著聽取市長的演說，也就是前天登上SLUSH恆綠舞台的座談人之一，不過如同芬蘭人含蓄的個性，整場遊行非常安靜，我參與了部分的路段，沒有聽到任何口號，也沒有施放狼煙的火炬。至於當天其他的利益團體是否也有上街頭抗議與示威，我本身只有目睹反法西斯團體高舉布條呼喊口號，內容是自由、友誼與團結(Vapaus, Toveruus & Solidaarisuus)，周圍雖然有警車戒備，但氣氛並不緊張，因為我們可以看到很多警員其實是拿著手機或是相機對著群眾拍照。雖然我沒有看到極右團體的出現，但是隔天的新聞也報導了示威中揮舞的右旋萬字旗(Swastika flags)被沒收並且有四人因此被羈押，隨後也遭各界嚴厲譴責。然而，我認為整體的氣氛也就如同另一項芬蘭傳統一樣沉著，即獨立日接見典禮(Linnan Juhlat)，超過千名的重要貢獻人士會被邀請至總統府，排成兩列緩緩前進一一與總統和第一夫人握手，不過這樣的節目卻能超過兩百萬人的收看，以總人口五百五十多萬人的芬蘭而言，我認為這是極高的比例。 為了讓遠道而來的國際志工能對北歐創業圈有更多了解，SLUSH也提供了國際志工周的行程，參訪了創業加速器，並且到當地新創的工作環境，與員工面對面談論開發產品的願景及未來的產業影響。大會結束後兩天是新創的參訪，第一站來到Maria 01，也就是三天前台灣芬蘭發表日的合作夥伴，他們是創立於2016年的非營利組織，志在打造一個北歐最大的新創校園，而場地就選在超過百年歷史的一座醫院遺址，而市政府也同意他們的企劃。取名來自於原本醫院的名字(Maria Hospital)，後面加上零一的靈感來自於風險資本家彼得提爾(Peter Thiel)的暢銷書。 而目前一萬兩千平方公尺占地的工作空間已容納九十家新創公司，活絡的氣氛讓人很難想像這裡曾經是一座醫院，除了不定時在官方帳號限時動態發佈他們在地底通道又發現幾張遺棄的病床。 而後我們到了當地的風險資本(Venture Capital)企業MAKI.VC，雖然是2018年一月才開始注資的基金，但已手握八千萬歐元，投入三十家新創，而其中之一就是我前面寫到的虛擬實境公司Glue。在聽取財務長的簡報時，我們才逐漸了解獨角獸企業的概念，也就是在上市櫃前即估值超過十億美元的新創公司。而風險資本家投資標的就是找尋下一隻獨角獸，因為資本公司的投資報酬並不是計算每個項目的利潤，而是只要有一家明星標的的高報酬可以覆蓋其他虧損的新創，整體策略就算成功，因此獨角獸對於整個新創圈的投資氛圍是很重要的。最後一站，我們到了新創網路銀行Holvi，與我們常見到來自英國的Revolut或是Monzo以及來自德國的N26單純的消費金融卡不一樣，因為他們目標客群是線上購物商的經營者，也就是加強收款的功能，讓中小企業主給與消費者更多的付款選項，此外還有一個特點是他們與愛沙尼亞的電子公民計畫(e-Residency)有身份驗證的合作，如果使用者並非目前營運國家如芬蘭、德國與奧地利等的居民，可以運用電子公民的選項，而填寫其他地區的住址。 在芬蘭一周的尾聲，是在周六晚上的志工專屬會後派對(Volunteer afterparty)，但是這次不像四天前官方的會後派對在主會場的巨大場地舉辦，而是移到郊區的改建倉庫活動場館，前身是國家鐵路局的火車頭生產廠房。派對的性質則是與先前相似，有廣大舞池與DJ台，飲品也是似曾相識的琴酒長飲、蘋果酒和拉格啤酒。 不過整場派對最大的不同是，這次在工作崗位上的都不是先前看到的志工，而是指派工作給我們的頭仔，也就是在志工手冊上面看得到照片的大人物。當我們走進衣帽間準備領取號碼牌時就看到整場論壇的執行長，或是排隊領取盒裝食物時就是從營運長的手中接過泰式炒麵。這也是我整場旅程中對於芬蘭平等文化的最深刻印證，不論頭銜或是資歷，於不同時段在團隊中相互合作，切換工作角色以增進同理心，共同提升顧客體驗，也讓我想起十一月拿到的手冊中，他們花了三頁的篇幅敘述志工應該展現的正向態度，並且詳列行為準則，嚴禁各種形式的歧視，都是為了打造友善包容的組織文化以及優質的工作環境。 一場看似能夠濃縮成兩天的大型活動，我認為用兩周的時間都無法路過每個攤位，或是僅僅了解每個區域的功能。而赫爾辛基也是，一周的時間無法見到她的全貌，這是我第三次拜訪辛基，但仍然是每天在不同角落發現嶄新世界。踏上歸途之前發現行李箱多了三本新創產業的出版品，分別是《Startup Guide Nordics》、《CoFounder: The SLUSH 2018 How To Pitch, Succeed & Win Issue》、《The State of European Tech》，完整消化應該是幾個月之後的事了，文章打到這裡也超過九千字了，最後做個簡短的收尾。希望計畫前往北歐創業圈發展的朋友能在論壇中找到合夥人或是天使投資人，也希望其他單純逛展的學生能認識新朋友也對北歐創業圈有多一點了解。歡迎讀者在下方留言，點擊掌聲或是分享給更多朋友。",Wes

https://medium.com/draup-technology/draup-technology-2bfec993ed0c?source=tag_archive---------107-----------------------,Draup Django,Stateful Deletion/Updation:,"Draup Platform Follow Draup Technology -- Listen Share At Draup, we take problem-solving to the next level by using cutting-edge technologies and having some of the brightest minds running highly complex algorithms on huge volumes of data. While we have the capabilities to solve most challenges, we also rely on open-sourcing which equips us with the right tools which allows us to find truly unique and innovate solutions to several problems. The team at Draup has been trying to solve the problem of stateful deletion/updation at the ORM level for Django. Whilst solving the problem, we also wanted to build a generic solution for ORM, so it could be used by Django-developers as well. Stateful Deletion/Updation: Stateful deletion is when an object cannot be directly deleted, without a prior prompt message (when deleting a single object entity, the prompt message gesticulates all the other dependent objects tagged along with the parent entity, before deleting it). Stateful updation occurs while transferring object dependencies from one object entity to another object entity, through which duplicate entries from database-tables can be erased. Draup Django: Draup Django is primarily a Pip Package. It provides stateful deletion/updation and is, availablehere. Installation: pip install draup-django Utilities: Get Affected Objects: Lists out all the dependent objects(Prompt-Messages). getAffectedObjectstakes input dict with ID as key and reference of the model. Delete Object: Deletes an object with all the other dependent objects. deleteObjecttakes input dict with ID, and force_delete as key and reference of the model. Update Object: Transfers object dependencies from one object to another object. updateObjectDependenciestakes an input source, and destination objects. Usage: Sample model : Parent Table : Child Table : Code : Output : Prompt Message ofgetAffectedObjectsfunction Note: Every function returns the error_list, and hence only the operation is successful only if it is empty. According to the above child/parent table, the updateObjectDependencies function will transfer the object dependency from id:1 to id:2, so the parent_id ofBobwill become 2. Updated Child Table : Limitation : updateObjectDependencieswill not work in case of a unique constraint, and one-to-one field in the model.

Do you guarantee Data-Security? Everyone is a Tech-Company! One way to find out if Blockchain is suitable for your business is to evaluate your firm needs. Another way is to evaluate to opportunities Blockchain opens up on efficiency and security improvements, alternative financing for new business units or expansion. The hype, speculative new assets such as Cryptocurrencies and alternative fundraising means like ICOs, surrounding ‘Blockchain’ has exaggerated the realistic capabilities and applications of this new technology. Businesses, developers, and investors have yet to identify the right applications that are appropriate for distributed ledger technology. Databases Databases have been used for decades to persist state and query data. Decades worth of research has been invested to optimize the different layers of query processing. Naturally, they have the highest performance in terms of transaction throughput and query latency. However, all along, they have been designed to be centrally managed by a single authority. Hence, no consensus mechanism is required across different parties. Furthermore, centralizes services, servers, datacenter are prone to cyber-attacks Permissionless Blockchains Permissionless Blockchains are public ledgers that are not managed by a centralized authority. That is, the ledger is distributed across a dynamic network of peers. The brilliance of Satoshi, was to present a design that maintains consensus on the distributed state in a dynamic and trustless network. This means that permissionless Blockchains can tolerate a (fraction of the) network with Byzantine or untrusted behavior. As everything comes with a price, the tradeoff here is performance cost (throughput and latency). In Bitcoin, the drastic performance hit is because of the POW protocol itself which by design is slow. In comparison to normal databases, in any permissionless Blockchain, a performance hit is inevitable. Because no matter what, to maintain the consistency of the distributed state, there has to be communication between the different peers in the (geographically distributed) network. Permissioned Blockchains Permissioned Blockchains represent a hybrid design. They are not centralized to a single entity, yet they are authorized to a small set of preselected trusted peers that can write state. Since the database network is not scaled to a large number of public nodes, as in the case for permissionless Blockchains, its performance in terms of throughput and latency is much better. Nonetheless, its performance cannot compete with a centralized database. After looking at these different systems, it is easy to realize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Everything is a trade-off. Different applications have different requirements and hence different appropriate solutions. The sole distinction between public and private blockchain is related to who is allowed to participate in the network, execute the consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. A public blockchainnetwork is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. The network typically has an incentivizing mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network. Bitcoin is one of the largest public blockchain networks in production today. One of the drawbacks of a public blockchain is the substantial amount of computational power that is necessary to maintain a distributed ledger at a large scale. Another disadvantage is the openness of public blockchain, which implies little to no privacy for transactions and only supports a weak notion of security. A private blockchainnetwork requires an invitation and must be validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules put in place by the network starter. Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned network. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions. Whether to adopt blockchain is not merely a technological decision; it is also a business decision. Great use cases solve real problems at a cost that is significantly lower than the benefits the adoption brings. Blockchain’s unique properties, meaning that a new analytical framework is useful, in part because of the fact that blockchain has emerged at a unique point in society’s technological development. While the application of technology to improve business processes is nothing new, previous generations of technology were predominantly about the faster and more secure exchange of information. Blockchain, meanwhile, is about the exchange of value; it is intended to enable individuals to exchange currency and other assets with one another without relying on a third party to manage the transactions. It also implies the dramatic redefinition of the business processes associated within and between companies. Blockchain’s strategic value is mainly in cost reduction Blockchain might have the disruptive potential to be the basis of new operating models, but its initial impact will be to drive operational efficiencies. Cost can be taken out of existing processes by removing intermediaries or the administrative effort of record keeping and transaction reconciliation. This can shift the flow of value by capturing lost revenues and creating new revenues for blockchain-service providers. Based on a McKinsey survey, “approximately 70 percent of the value at stake in the short term is in cost reduction, followed by revenue generation and capital relief” Characteristics of high‐potential use cases Cryptocurrency’s core advantages are low-fee transferability, ability to transact cross-borders and deflationary character in case of value appreciation/ storage. Blockchain’s main advantages are decentralization, cryptographic security, transparency, and immutability. It allows information to be verified and value to be exchanged without having to rely on a third-party authority. Optimize blockchain strategy based on market position. Identified promising use cases, develop strategies and design choices to shape a viable solution. Industry leader should act now to maintain their market positions and take advantage of the opportunity to set industry standards. As dominant players pursuing use cases with fewer requirements for coordination and regulatory approval, they can establish market solutions.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/apple-2018-retrospective-21a06d1f82db?source=tag_archive---------54-----------------------,Why Apple Struggled in 2018: A Retrospective,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Dane O'Leary Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 4 Listen Share Putting personal biases to the side, Apple is objectively one of the most important tech companies in existence today. Or at the very least, certainly the most influential. If you doubt that fact, consider this: Shortly after its release, the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result, many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing, those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future. In short, we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today, whether they have an Apple logo or not, were made in Apple’s image. But 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple, especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design, Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate, iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been. Though the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first, many reviews praised the iPhone X, calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact, there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018, the hype was only just starting to dissipate. Since we’ve turned a corner into the new year, it’s time to look back on Apple’s biggest hardware and software launches of 2018, paying particular attention to the mistakes that are obvious with the benefit of hindsight while also giving Apple due credit for several successes. Apple HomePod iPad 2018 with Pencil Support PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8 & iPhone 8 Plus AirPlay 2 WWDC 2018 MacBook Pro 2018 iPhone XS & iPhone XR Apple Watch Series 4 iPad Pro 2018 Mac Mini 2018 Summary The HomePod was supposed to be Apple’s answer to voice assistant-powered smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Originally announced in June 2017 for a December release, HomePod ended up getting delayed until its eventual launch in February. Unfortunately for Apple, once the HomePod was released and its limitations became clear, there simply wasn’t as much hype for the HomePod as there had been for the iPhone X. As a product, HomePod is only appealing if you’re already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. As a product, HomePod is only appealing if you’re already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. HomePod is, as a product, only appealing to consumers who are already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. Siri is the sole voice assistant on offer here and she’s proven, time and again, to be far less capable than the Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa by no small margin. [Just read “Apple’s Siri is an Embarrassment,” published byForbes, if you don’t believe me.] Worst of all, HomePod lacks basic functions that competing high-end smart speakers have been offering, and much of that is due to the ineptitude of Siri. However, beyond the fact that Siri gets outclassed by all three of her main competitors when it comes to answering questions, most smart speakers let you connect multiple units simultaneously for stereo sound. While this was originally marketed as something HomePod could do, the feature wasn’t available out-of-the-box. Anyone who purchased more than one HomePod unit at launch soon discovered they needed AirPlay 2 for stereo sound and multi-room audio. In areview for CNET, Megan Wollerton highlighted another major drawback to the HomePod. Though she commended the HomePod for its incredible audio quality, making it a great speaker for audiophiles, Wollerton pointed out how HomePod has native support only for Apple’s own streaming music service, Apple Music. Spotify, Pandora, and other popular music streaming services — which are more ubiquitous than Apple Music — weren’t available without using AirPlay as a workaround. Normally, a speaker that doesn’t offer native support for your desired streaming service would offer a work-around with Bluetooth, but that’s not an option here. Just to be totally clear, let me state this clearly… Apple HomePod doesn’t have Bluetooth. For some reason, Bluetooth 5 is, in fact, listed among HomePod’s specifications although Android and Windows devices can’t leverage the Bluetooth to connect to HomePod. To use HomePod, youmust havean iOS device. Assuming you have an iPhone, you could theoretically use AirPlay to push music from Spotify or your other music streaming service of choice to the HomePod, but for the steep price of $349 — which is higher than any Amazon Echo speaker but less than the Google Home Max — HomePod has niche appeal at best and is just too limited to truly be asmartspeaker. Needless to say, it didn’t appear on many holiday wishlists. [Side note: Apple has continued updating HomePod’s software throughout the year. For what it’s worth, HomePod now offers better integration with other Apple products like Apple TV. It also now offers the ability to pair two HomePods for stereo sound with AirPlay 2, integration with your calendar, and several other features that, honestly, should’ve been available from launch.] In hindsight, the education-focused event held in Chicago in March 2018 ended up being one of Apple’s best moments of the year from a critical standpoint, so I’m including it here to give credit where credit’s due. However, there’s really not a ton to talk about. At the event, Apple unveiled the “New iPad,” revealing the long-awaited addition of Apple Pencil support, which makes the 2018 iPad newly relevant for educational uses. Best of all, you could buy the newest Pencil-compatible iPad foras little as $329, making it the lowest-priced device in Apple’s current hardware lineup. So, yes, this was certainly one of the bright spots of Apple’s year. There’s not much to say about the launch of PRODUCT(RED) versions of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, either, besides Apple’s frustrating decision not to give iPhone X the PRODUCT(RED) treatment. The release of PRODUCT(RED) iPhones is bittersweet. Sure, they lookreallycool, but the spiffy red color doesn’t necessarily warrant waiting months to upgrade. If you like PRODUCT(RED) devices but didn’t want to wait for one, you might be tempted to buy your device a second time when the PRODUCT(RED) version finally hits shelves. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next model. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next model. I can only think of one real reason why Apple didn’t just release the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8s at the time of the iPhone 8 launch. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort by Apple to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next generation that’s right around the corner. The omission of the iPhone X from the PRODUCT(RED) lineup wasleaked in advance, so while it wasn’t really a surprise, the exlusion was a huge oversight on Apple’s part, not to mention a missed opportunity. With a portion of proceeds from each PRODUCT(RED) purchase being donated to a great cause, it probably would’ve pushed some iPhone X holdouts over the edge; however, since the iPhone X was more expensive to manufacture, it’s likely Apple probably didn’t want (RED) donations eating into their per-unit revenue. Again, I want to give credit where credit is due, and the long-awaited AirPlay 2 was a highlight of 2018. AirPlay is Apple’s proprietary wireless technology for streaming media between Apple devices. Traditionally, AirPlay was designed for use with music, video, and gaming, but there were inherent limitations — particularly regarding latency and a general lack of utility— that restricted AirPlay’s usefulness. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could further refine HomePod and its multi-room audio capabilities. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could further refine HomePod and its multi-room audio capabilities. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could spend more time refining the HomePod and fine-tuning its multi-room audio capabilities. Then AirPlay 2 was finally released in May 2018, which was mere days before the first beta of iOS 12 was unveiled. When it was finally released, AirPlay 2 was a welcome improvement and delivery on promises that had been made since before iOS 11. [Side note: As mentioned previously, AirPlay 2 was designed with the HomePod in mind since it allows you to connect two HomePods simultaneously for stereo sound.] In terms of hardware, Apple played it close to the vest at WWDC 2018 in June. Of course, WWDC is a software-focused event, so Apple took the opportunity to unveil software that would pave the way for the remainder of the year. Most of Apple’s WWDC coverage was positive, especially when it came to iOS, tvOS, and macOS. On the mobile side, Apple was universally praised for the work that went into iOS 12. Of course, the company really needed this win to help weather a pretty serious storm. In late 2017, users discovered their older iPhones were getting throttled, meaning processor performance was intentionally reduced. Amidst accusations ofplanned obsolescence— in other words, intentionally slowing down older phones, which essentially forces users to buy new devices — Apple said the purpose of doing this was actually tomaintainuser experience. According to Apple, iPhones with old batteries could experience random shutdowns if their processors continue maxing their respective clock speeds. So Apple quietly lowered those processors’ performance caps. In hindsight, the fact that Apple wasn’t transparent with the practice of limited processor speeds on older iPhone devices is surely what rubbed users the wrong way. Then iOS 12 came into the picture. Both the industry and consumers were extremely impressed with what Apple delivered in iOS 12. The company reportedly dedicated a ton of resources to this version of iOS so it wouldwork exceptionally wellon older devices. Suddenly, older iPhones like the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 had new life. [Side note:It’s very possible — perhaps even likely — that the performance improvements iOS 12 brought to older iPhones contributed to the lackluster sales of 2018 iPhones, too.] With both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, Apple TV 4K is competitive and ideal for home theater setups. With both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, Apple TV 4K is competitive and ideal for home theater setups. Though it shipped with Dolby Vision support, Apple TV 4K notably lacked Dolby Atmos support. Fortunately, tvOS 12 rectified this omission by bringing support forbothDolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In turn, Apple TV 4K has become much more competitive among streaming hardware and is particularly appealing to home theater connoisseurs. For the Mac, Apple unveiled macOS 10.14 Mojave, which notably brought system-wide dark mode — for which users had long been begging — to macOS for the first time. There were a slew of other additions and improvements besides dark mode, too; in particular, Mojave brings a revamped App Store, a new Home app, and dozens of welcome quality-of-life changes. Since the first Touchbar-sporting MacBrook Pros launched in 2016, Apple has released a new MacBook Pro each year. I personally think it’s because the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s best-selling personal computing device — though I don’t currently have concrete numbers to verify this — so it behooves the company to keep the people buying these uber-expensive powerbooks happy. The 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reactions. Though the design and build quality were praised (which is typical for Apple products), the MacBook Pro 2016 lost all I/O but a couple USB C ports, forcing buyers — largely professionals and power users who probably relied on all those ports — to adjust to “dongle life.” Then there’s the fact that the new MacBook Pro wastechnically outdated at launch, built on sixth-generation processors while competitors were offering the newer seventh-gen Intel “Kaby Lake” chipsets. In 2017, Apple addressed this gripe by updating the MacBook Pro again, offering the Kaby Lake chips to further boost the notebook’s power. So after last refreshing the MacBook Pro in 2012, we got two consecutive updates in 2016 and 2017. Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, which could make it harder for consumers to buy a new MacBook Pro since a better model is always within reach. Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, which could make it harder for consumers to buy a new MacBook Pro since a better model is always within reach. That’s why it was so surprising for Apple to update the MacBook Proagainat the tail end of July 2018. On the one hand, Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, so we shouldn’t be surprised when it happens in 2019. On the other hand, these annual upgrades make it harder to buy a new MacBook Pro because you’re never more than 12 months from an even better version. And a MacBook Pro is no small investment. In the positive column, the MacBook Pro 2018 features Intel’s eighth-generation processor, so it’s an even better workhorse for anyone who needs power on the go. Specifically, this new MacBook Pro is great for graphic design, video editing, music production, and other intensive tasks. MacBook Pro 2018 features Apple’s T2 security chip. This is the first time Apple has put their own custom silicon in a Mac. MacBook Pro 2018 features Apple’s T2 security chip. This is the first time Apple has put their own custom silicon in a Mac. The new MacBook Pro also features Apple’s T2 chip, which is an important moment in tech history as this is the first time Apple’s has put their own silicon in a Mac. Granted, the T2 chip deals primarily with security and biometric authentication via the TouchID sensor, so it’s not as exciting as, say,Apple’s A4 chipwas in 2010. But when you consider the huge lead Apple has gained in smartphone performance by producing their own mobile processors, it’ll be interesting to see how long it takes for Apple to start making processors for their laptops and desktops in-house. Other new features added to the 2018 MacBook Pro include TrueTone display and native Siri support. You may recall that TrueTone debuted on the iPhone X, allowing for on-the-fly display recalibration that adjusts to the color temperature of your environment. Then Siri is… well, Siri, but now the MacBook Pro has support for “Hey Siri” just like an iPhone or iPad. Beyond the obligatory processor upgrade, the inclusion of Apple’s T2 chip, and a couple software tweaks here or there, the 2018 MacBook Pro was simply a slightly-improved version of the 2017 MacBook Pro. If the spec bump wouldn’t yield noticeable improvements in your workflow — which, again, is probably only significant for video editing and other intensive processes — the MacBook Pro 2018 probably isn’t all that exciting for most people. As in previous years, Apple kicked off the fall season with the company’s annual iPhone event at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Cupertino campus. Whatever Apple planned to release in 2018 was inevitably going to pale in comparison to the iPhone X. Whatever Apple planned to release in 2018 was inevitably going to pale in comparison to the iPhone X. To be fair, there really wasn’t much Apple could’ve done to top the iPhone X from the previous year. With 2018 being an “S” year, meaning incremental upgrades with largely the same form factor, whatever Apple was planning to release would inevitably pale in comparison to the hype and excitement that had surrounded the iPhone X. In the months leading to the event, numerous leaks spoiled those revelations. News of three iPhone models had been making the rounds; two of those iPhones were direct successors to the iPhone X, one with the same 5.8-inch OLED display and one with a larger 6.5-inch OLED display. The third device was the hotly-anticipated budget version of the iPhone X. Nobody could be certain what it would be called, but it was pegged to land in-between the two iPhone X successors in terms of screen size, sporting a 6.1-inch (likely LCD) display. Sure enough, at the event on September 12, Apple unveiled the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the iPhone XR with the latter being the budget-conscious version marketed as “the new generation of iPhone.” Unfortunately, the price hikes of 2017 continued in 2018. The iPhone XS had the same starting price of the iPhone X at $999 in the US. If you wanted the bigger version, the starting price was $1099 and could climb as high as $1,449 for 512 GB of storage. The iPhone XR seemed cheap by comparison even though its starting price of $749 was already higher than mid-range Android phones like the OnePlus 6 ($529). All three of the 2018 iPhones featured the buttonless, FaceID-centric design that debuted with the iPhone X, eliminating the design language that debuted with the iPhone 6. Additionally, all three models features the same impressive A12 Bionic processor, meaning that you’re getting the same industry-leading power no matter the price tier you choose. The general public had several key issues with the 2018 iPhones. First, there’s the price creep. With the smartphone industry as a whole tending to follow Apple’s lead, smartphones hitting or even surpassing the $1,000 price point is becoming disturbingly common in the wake of the iPhone X. Then there’s the fact that none of the 2018 iPhones have TouchID fingerprint sensors, which had been a popular iPhone feature since the iPhone 5S debuted in 2013. TouchID wasn’t just fast, it was familiar. Apple should’ve had at least one transitional generation of iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of immediately forcing FaceID’s learning curve onto buyers. Apple should’ve had at least one transitional generation of iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of immediately forcing FaceID’s learning curve onto buyers. It’s one thing to eliminate the fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition on a device that’s intentionally experimental like the iPhone X; however, it would have been smart to have at least one generation of transitional iPhone that offeredbothTouchID and FaceID instead of pulling the rug out from beneath buyers, forcing the slight learning curve of a brand new security method onto them. Having controversially discontinued the iPhone SE, iPhone XR might’ve been Apple’s saving grace if the device hadn’t started on the wrong foot. In particular, the iPhone XR’s display — an 828 x 1792 “Liquid Retina” LCD at 326 pixels per inch (PPI) — was considered by the majority of critics and tech journalists to be way too low for a 2018 flagship, and nearly as much of a deal-breaker for prospective buyers as the high cost of the iPhone XS and XS Max. Though many tech critics and reviewers would come to praise the iPhone XR and its display once they got their hands on the device, it’s likely the damage had already been done. It left users with two choices: Pony up for thousand-dollar iPhones or hang onto their previous-generation iPhones. If reports from Apple’s supply chain are any indication, a lot of people chose the latter. Alongside the new iPhones launched at the fall event, Apple introduced what could be considered Apple’s “sleeper hit” of 2018: the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple Watch has long been the gold standard for wearables, and it’s only gotten better with each generation. With the Series 4, Apple flexed its muscles, making a great product even better — and, more specifically, even more relevant — by adding some pretty groundbreaking health features. The new Apple Watch has a feature called “fall detection,” which is exactly what it sounds like. If the person wearing the watch takes a serious spill, the watch will give that person the ability to easily call for emergency services. Besides the fall detection, the Apple Watch Series 4 also brings electrocardiograph (ECG) capabilities to a wearable device for the first time. It’s works pretty brilliantly: Just put your finger on the watch’s digital crown to “close the circuit” and allow the Apple Watch to read your heart rhythm. Apple Watch Series 4 has become a legitimate medical diagnostic device. Apple Watch Series 4 has become a legitimate medical diagnostic device. On paper, this makes the Apple Watch Series 4 a legitimatemedical diagnostic devicethat will determine which type of heart rhythm you have and could, in theory, detect a condition like atrial fibrillation. Looking back, the Apple Watch Series 4 is arguably one of Apple’s strongest products of the year. If it weren’t for wearables being practically passé at this point, the Apple Watch Series 4 would’ve been a much bigger seller. But wait, there’s more. As we neared the holiday season, Apple announced the next-generation iPad Pro to mixed reactions. There’s no denying the new iPad Pro is a capable device. With slimmed bezels, FaceID, and a new utilitarian design language that’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5 era of Apple design, the new iPad Pro is inarguably the most powerful tablet on the market. Benchmarks have shown the A12X Bionic chip in the 2018 iPad Pro shatters records, raising the bar in terms of how much power a tablet computer can offer. And it’s not just the single-core scores impressive; the iPad Pro’smulti-core benchmarksrival even high-end laptop computers. There are two major problems with the iPad Pro 2018: price and the inherent limitations of iOS. There are two major problems with the iPad Pro 2018: price and the inherent limitations of iOS. So what’s the problem? Well, there are two. First, the iPad Pro is held back by the high cost. At a starting price of $799, the cost of the iPad Pro is comparable to what you could pay for a similarly-specced Windows laptop. It comes down to this: Who’s going to pay $800 or more for a tablet? If you’re hoping for the iPad Pro to be a productivity machine, you’ll have to throw down some serious cash: The Apple Pencil, which is basically a required accessory to really get the most out of the iPad Pro, also got a second generation with an accompanying price hike. Whereas it previously cost $99, the second-generation Apple Pencil retails for $129. Adding a keyboard, case, and the new Apple Pencil (because the first-gen Pencil won’t work with the new iPad Pro) to a 12.9-inch Wifi-only 64 GB iPad Pro, you’re looking at investing well over $1,200. For atablet. But if you want to get a higher storage option, you’re easily crossing into MacBook Pro price territory. And don’t even get me started on the fact that the new iPad Pro doesn’t work with the first-generation Apple Pencil; Apple is strong-arming you into buying the newer and needlessly more expensive expensive version. The other major issue holding the iPad Pro back is iOS. Even with the industry-leading benchmarks, all that power is for nought if the operating system doesn’t let you to harness that power or take advantage of it in meaningful ways. As it stands, the iPhone’s mobile operating system just isn’t robust enough to take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s incredibly processing power. Plus, in the absence of support for external storage devices, a decent file management system, and support for desktop-class applications, the iPad Pro remains essentially a glorified media and web browsing machine. Assuming there are apps available to give you the functionality needed to be truly productive on the iPad Pro, again, you’re paying nearly the same cost as a decently-specced MacBook Pro, so what’s the point? The 2018 iPad Pro ended up being a powerful tablet that everyone would love to own and play with, but few can justify its price. There are just a few particular instances when an iPad Pro is a reasonable purchase; for instance, there’s a lot here for illustrators and artists to love. Otherwise, the iPad Pro serves as clear indication of how the future of computing isn’t quite ready to become our present. It was a long time coming, but Apple finally updated its lowest-cost Apple PC. And yes, the price of the Mac Mini increased, too. Before November 2018, Apple had last shown the Mac Mini love in 2014. Among its Mac lineup, the Mini was conceptualized as a budget-friendly, lower-powered option, ideal for home servers, as family PCs, or for less demanding tasks. But after four years, Mac Mini could no longer keep up. The new Mac Mini is a modern entry-level desktop in almost every sense of the word. Updated with Apple’s Thunderbolt USB-C ports and an optional 10-gigabit ethernet port, the Mini checks most boxes that are essential in 2019, bringing the miniaturized desktop up to snuff with competitors. At its unveiling, the new Mac Mini was a welcome improvement, but it hasn’t been without its problems. Apple has made the Mini non-user-upgradeable, which continues to be a point of contention for users. But Apple has thrown users a bone: It is technically possible to upgrade the RAM or SSD in your Mac Mini, but it has to be done by a technician at your nearest Apple Store. If you were hoping to use a Mac Mini for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, you’ll probably need an external GPU. If you were hoping to use a Mac Mini for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, you’ll probably need an external GPU. If you had hoped to use a Mini in lieu of an iMac for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, be aware that the Mac Mini’s GPU is pretty lackluster. You’ll probably be shopping for an external GPU sooner than later. Perhaps the most controversial move was the price hike, a common refrain in 2018. Whereas the Mac Mini previously started at an entry-friendly price of $499, the 2018 Mac Mini starts at $799, which is an increase of nearly 40 percent. Admittedly, it’s not terrible value for what you’re getting, but the increased price puts it within throwing distance of more capable, powerful hardware like the MacBook Pro. So if you’re planning on getting a Mini and even considering upgrading its specs, you’re probably better off skipping the Mini altogether and getting a base model MacBook Pro or iMac that’s simply more capable. It’s clear that 2018 was a pretty rough year for Apple overall. The products — and the hardware in particular — Apple released throughout 2018 are great, but with the prices ballooning year over year, Apple needs to step back and really reconsider what kind ofvaluethese devices are bringing. Is it enough to warrant such high costs? Beyond the lackluster iPhone releases and the controversial HomePod, we’re still waiting for AirPower, the wireless charging pad announced during the iPhone X event in 2017 and originally slated for a 2018 release. We’re also still waiting for a follow-up to the Apple’s extremely popular AirPods. But there have been some wins, too. iOS 12 is more polished and capable than ever. The Apple Watch Series 4 is literallysaving lives. The iPad Pro 2018 is posting benchmarks many laptops can only dream of hitting. Apple took buyers for granted, failing to provide compelling reasons or incentive to invest in new products. Apple took buyers for granted, failing to provide compelling reasons or incentive to invest in new products. Unfortunately, most consumers don’t care about these landmark achievements, and Apple took for granted that the newest shiny toy with the Apple logo on it would be enough to buy. With most of Apple’s 2018 product releases, the problem is that Apple isn’t providing compelling reasons or incentive for consumers to buy new models instead of keeping what they already have. For 2019, I’d like to see Apple rein in the price hikes; it’s getting to the point where it’s hard to recommend Apple’s incredible products when the pricing is obscene and turns most people off buying new Apple products altogether. Moreover, I’d like to see Apple do something unique with the 2019 iPhones, something to renew excitement for Apple and re-secure its position at the front of the technology pack.",Dane O'Leary,https://me.dm/@daneoleary,0,19 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg,2020-03-30T15:33:24.497Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@levihpatton/the-dark-side-of-assumption-69978454b804?source=tag_archive---------108-----------------------,The Dark Side of Assumption,Written byLevi Patton,"Levi Patton Follow -- Listen Share Assumptions are all around us. We make them all the time, often without thinking twice. As designers, we arm ourselves with all kinds of tools, techniques, and methodologies aimed at clearing the path of assumption so we can design for users, and not for ourselves. Still, assumptions are always out there, creeping in around the edges waiting for the right moment to slide in and cloud our judgment. Sometimes assumptions can be expensive. And there’s nothing like an assumption blowing up in your face to make you think twice about taking action without first having all the facts. Last month I made an assumption based on good-natured intentions that ended up costing $500, some strained relationships, and 100 pounds of spoiled meat. Allow me to explain. I live in the mountains where I rent a small carriage house above my landlord’s garage. I get to drink my morning coffee on a porch that sits at 7,500 feet and looks out at snow-capped peaks and miles of pine forest. Humblebrag aside, it is by far the most amazing place I have ever lived, and I’m super grateful that I get to call it home. Because of this, I have a lot of respect for the house, the property, and am in great standing with the landlord. So when he went out of town on a 10-day hunting trip this summer and left the light to one of the property’s outbuildings on, it only made sense to do the good-neighborly thing and shut the door — which was ajar — and turn off the light. Iassumedthat he had been working in the outbuilding during the day with the light on, and had forgotten to turn it off. I even had accumulated mental evidence (assumption ammunition) that thishadto be the case. Not once in my 2+ years of living here had I ever seen that outbuilding with the light on. Also, with the door being partially open, something just didn’t seem right. It seemed so natural just to march over, turn off the light, close the door, and cash in on that ‘good deed glow.’ I didn’t even consider any alternatives as to what could be going on in that scenario. I thought I had just saved my landlord 10-days worth of wasted electricity and prevented some mountain animal from wandering into his storage room. I got a text from my landlord 10 days later: “I’m DESPERATELY trying to figure out when the light was turned off in the outbuilding.” An anxiety-boulder dropped in my stomach and started a panic-landslide through the rest of my body. I hadn’t even thought about the light in the garage since turning it off over a week earlier. My mind raced through the possibilities of what could be wrong. Was the light supposed to be on!? Why!? A cascade of panic-riddled assumptions ran through my head (assumption inception). I learned later that night that leaving the light on was indeed intentional. It just so happens that the power for the outbuilding is connected to that specific light switch, and that there was over 100 pounds of elk meat in a freezer tucked away in the corner of the room. In the 10 days since the power was shut off, the entire 100 pounds had gone rancid. The cost of butchering the meat alone was over $500, and it didn’t just belong to my landlord, but also to a group of friends from a previous trip who had expected to later receive their share. I was devastated. I honestly cannot remember a time where I felt so tremendously crushed with guilt. It was a Friday night after a long week, I had just made dinner, and was looking forward to enjoying the evening and the rest of the weekend. After the conversation with my landlord, I just sat there and stared at the cooling food feeling nauseous. A good-natured assumption I had made without a second guess had just caused some serious Friday night feel-bads. What went so wrong? The more I turned over the scenario in my mind, the more the idea of assumption became the core of this frustrating mess. Yes, I made some obvious assumptions regarding the decision to turn off the light: I assumed that leaving the light on was accidental I assumed that I was ‘doing the right thing’ I assumed that there was no connection between the light and anything else in the room (the freezer) However, flipping the perspective and examining my landlord's side of the story comes with another list of assumptions: He assumed that none of the tenants would think it was weird that a light was on day and night for over 10 days (a light that is never on) He assumed that none of the tenants would turn off the light, thinking that it was left on mistakenly He assumed that this unobvious connection between the light and the power to the freezer (that was known to him) would also be known to us What made this particular situation so disastrous, was that assumptions were made on both sides. Each of us saw the situation through the lens of our own narrow perspectives and didn’t think to dig a little deeper and empathize with the other players involved in the experience. Communication on either end could have easily helped to avoid a wasteful and depressing situation. A text about the light being on, or a sticky note on the light saying, “don’t turn this switch off” would have easily prevented things from turning out so grim. A text on my end saying, “hey, I just turned off the lights to the outbuilding” would have kept a depressing guilt-tsunami from flooding my Friday night. There is also the awkward issue of accountability. Who was more at fault in this scenario? Ultimately, I was asked to pay for “someor allof the $500+ cost of butchering the meat.” That’s a heavy price to pay for flipping a switch under the assumption that I was doing something good. I tend to be a little more conscious of assumption-making these days. Even a small, seemingly benign assumption can have serious consequences. As a designer, I always try my best to eliminate assumptions when creating experiences for users; but also when anticipating the needs of clients, working with teams, and thinking through any creative problem-solving situation. Once you notice how assumption-riddled our day-to-day can be, it’s hard to unsee just how many auto-pilot decisions we make purely based on conjecture. To a certain extent, it’s unavoidable, and I think we have to be okay with that. As long as you take notice when you’re making an assumption, and ask yourself, “is there something I’m not seeing here… what could go wrong if I go through with this action without having all the facts?” Maybe this is just a recipe for overthinking-anxiety, which I already tend to be prone to. All I know is that from here on out, I’ll always think twice before turning off a light switch that isn't my own.",Levi Patton,https://medium.com/@levihpatton?source=post_page---byline--69978454b804---------------------------------------,0,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg,2019-01-02T15:48:16.787Z,Medium
https://codeburst.io/create-a-segmented-auto-moving-sms-code-verification-input-in-react-native-373a580c4e8c?source=tag_archive---------55-----------------------,Create a Segmented Auto-Moving SMS Code Verification Input in React Native,Published incodeburst,"Jason Brown Follow codeburst -- Listen Share Many applications provide a way to verify a user based upon a text message. This can be a random code usually 4–6 numbers. It doesn’t really matter as we’ll build an input that can do it all, but one common interaction is auto-advancing inputs when you type. This on the surface can look trivial but can be complex when you are dealing with user interactions like pasting, deleting, and focus management. This tutorial was inspired by logging into Stripe and seeing how they handled their text code verification. This was adapted from web to native. 6 is arbitrary this will work with any amount as long as we base our calculations off of the length of the array. We start with a bit of state. We will hold our value in a single string and use thesplitmethod to turn it into an array. We will loop over ourCODE_LENGTHjust so we can grab the index and render in our display value. Our display value will beViews that have their border right the same color and size as the wrap. The wrapping div will provide the border look, and the display pieces will provide the separation on the inside. We will use some logic to remove the border from the last display so we don’t have a double border on the right side from the display and wrap border. If it’s the last input we apply ournoBorderstyle. We also use usealignItems: 'center'andjustifyContent: 'center'to center our text inside of each display cell. We need to get access to ourTextInputvia a ref so we can control it's focus. We render ourTextInput, and one important piece is to putvalue="""". The reason for this is to indicate to React that it's a controlled input, and that even if people type into we never want to display a value. If we left that off the text input would be uncontrolled and would have user input displayed. Instead of displaying the content in the input we have our value split from state and rendered in separateViews. We will render our input absolutely because we will want to control the movement of it later so that we don’t have to fake a cursor but instead move the input to the active cell. On important piece is controlling focus and blur. We will need to track whether or we have focus so we can display appropriate outlines. So we add a booleanfocusedvalue to state, and attach anonFocusandonBlurto our input. Not only that we need to handle what happens when the user presses on the outer wrap. If it’s pressed we need to focus on the input. In React Native we want to use a Touchable element, in our case the TouchableWithoutFeedback since we don’t need any other effects. So we add anonPressand call focus on ourrefthat we had created earlier. Calling focus directly like this will then trigger ouronFocushandler so we don't need to set any state in thehandlePressmethod. One important piece is moving the input. As the user types we will move it starting from position 0 through to the full length of the code. We do this so as the user types the input can display in the cell with a real cursor flashing. We do some math to determine the selected index to multiply by32which is just the width of each display cell. If our current length of typed in code is less than the total possible values then we return thevalues.lengthwhich is just the length of characters users have typed in. If we hit the point where the user has typed in all possible characters then we just return the total possible length of characters. This limits the input to always be visible in the last square and no further. Now when the user types we will have our change event fire. Generally you would update state with just updating the value fromonChangeTextbut because we addedvalue=""""the value will always be the singular character that the user typed. We are reference previous state so we need to use the callbacksetStatestyle. Also thehandleChangemethod could be potentially called with more than one character if the user pasted in the number. So to combat any possibility of over pasting past the maximum character limit we will combine the current state, new incoming value, thensliceit down to the maximum length. If a user pasted in8characters we would grab0to6in our case and only update the state with the first 6 characters. Also if the current length is greater than or equal to maximum code length we return null. This will prevent typing in more than the allowed amount or characters. Accessibility is important to think about and so we will need to re-create the outline that would normally display when the user has focus. We could add in the outline but choose to do it this way for better design/aesthetic purposes. To accomplish this we need to know if a current cell is selected, or if everything is all filled in. If it’s currently selected we want to render our outline, or if all numbers have been filled in then we want to render the outline in the last input. We do that by comparing the index we are looping over directly to the length of the characters that have been typed in. Then to check if it’s filled we compare length of values typed in and also check if the loop has gotten to the final input. We also need to check if the user is currently focused. If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. We render ourshadowView absolutely and give it aborderWidthof 4. Then we move itleft/right/bottom/top-4so that when the border renders it will line up exactly like an outline. We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from theonKeyPresscallback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can usesliceto remove the last character from ourvalueon state. One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th, but once they type in the final character theselectedIndexwill move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers, the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to theTextInputso we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. That’s it, we now have an input that auto-advances whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached.

https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/how-can-you-measure-the-importance-of-soft-skills-2ff48ee6bf5?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,How can you measure the importance of “soft skills”?,Digital Divisions,"Digital Divisions Bethany Crystal Follow Age of Awareness -- 7 Listen Share Earlier this fall, my husband and I took ourselves out for a “date night” in New York City and wound up at a Japanese steakhouse restaurant, one where you’re seating at a table of 8–10 other people and a chef cooks all of the food on a piping hot iron griddle right in front of you. We used to go for special occasions as a family growing up. Yes, the food (often a mix of stir fried vegetables and meat) is often quite good. But let’s be honest — you’re paying for the fun experience of watching food get prepared. It’s a highly social dining event. The chef will often play to his table, picking on the youngest one by encouraging them to catch shrimp tails in their pockets or “fake them out” with a prank container of hot sauce that they pretend to squirt right at you. When we went on date night, we were at a table of 6 — the two of us and four younger folks that looked to be high school age or early college. A couple of them were drinking, a couple weren’t, and the group of four was celebrating the youngest one’s birthday. While this was still a highly engaging experience, we were shocked to see one common similarity among the younger folks next to us:Each one of them had their phone directly in front of their face for 90% of the dinner / show experience. Yes, sometimes they were adding to their live Instagram story (for instance, when he created an “onion volcano” and set it on fire), but for most of the time, they were just…in different worlds. We had a lot of questions for them (which clearly we didn’t ask): Why pay so much money for an experience if you don’t intend to be physically present and enjoy the moment? Why celebrate a birthday if you’re barely going to engage with the people next to you? And what does the increased prevalence of technology in your pocket mean for the development of key inter-personal social skills among our youth? The importance of “soft skills” This term tends to get a bad rep. As soon as you add the word, “soft” to anything, a lot of assumptions immediately get in the way: That it’s somehow less important that its counterpart, “hard skills” That it’s “just the squishy stuff” that sounds good but you can’t really measure or teach That it implies traits that are inherently “more feminine” in some way (ergo certain types of people or personalities may not need this) This is hugely problematic. Just because we’re adding more technology to the way we operate at work doesn’t mean we still won’t need to interact as humans to do our jobs. And if four friends can’t even sit around at a dinner table together and enjoy each other’s company and the social dynamic from a chef in front of them, how might they behave in a more professional context at work in a boardroom? In a 2017 study by Harvard scholarDavid J Deming(which you can read here), he found that, despite advances in technology, the need in our economy for skills requiring “soft skills” is going up (not down). Here’s some of what he found: “Analyzing employment trends between 1980 and 2012, Deming found thatjobs requiring extensive interaction, such as teachers, managers, and nurses, grew by nearly 12 points as a share of the labor force, while analytical positions that required few social skills, including some engineering jobs, declined.Wages for “high math, low social skill” occupations increased by 5.9 percent, compared with 26 percent growth for “high math, high social skill” openings.”(Via:The 74) In case you’re more visual, here’s another way to put it. In an information age of more automation, the demand for “translator roles” — people who can either teach, manage, or interpret technology and systems, are more important than ever. To be clear, the definition of “soft skills” has so many different meanings any way you slice it. It is “people skills”? Is it communication skills? Is it workforce readiness training? And whether it’s one of these, all of these, or none of these, the next question is even trickier: Can this stuff be taught? This piece from The 74, digs much deeper into this study, these questions, and also some ways that schools (even at the K-12 level) are starting to incorporate some type of professional skills training into the classroom setting. It’s an incredibly worthwhile read and calls out some of the challenges (and hard-to-measure parts) of teaching skills like this. I’ve been thinking about this question for some time now and still don’t have an obvious answer. But I’d love to hear what you’ve seen. What’s working? What’s not? And how important is this “squishy stuff” in the end, anyway?

Parcel sniker seg innpå v2 Det er mange som gleder seg til den komplette redesignen av zero-config bundleren Parcel kommer ut, men den rakk dessverre ikke helt ut i 2018. Det den rakk var dog en ny minor-versjon — 1.11.0 — som blant annet inneholder HMR-støtte for Elm, samt Kotlin-støtte. I tillegg har man begynt å ta i bruk endel pakker fra Parcel 2 — så man unngår de aller største oppgraderingskostnadene! Rollup ute i 1.0.0! Rollup er den foretrukne bundleren for pakker i React-økosystemet, og har endelig blitt sluppet i sin første major!

https://codeburst.io/create-a-segmented-auto-moving-sms-code-verification-input-in-react-abb71b8de04a?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,Create a Segmented Auto-Moving SMS Code Verification Input in React,Published incodeburst,"Jason Brown Follow codeburst -- 1 Listen Share Many websites provide a mechanism to verify a user based upon a text message. This can be a random code usually 4–6 numbers. It doesn’t really matter as we’ll build an input that can do it all, but one common interaction is auto-advancing inputs when you type. This on the surface can look trivial but can be complex when you are dealing with user interactions like pasting, deleting, and focus management. This tutorial was inspired by logging into Stripe and seeing how they handled their text code verification. 6 is arbitrary this will work with any amount as long as we base our calculations off of the length of the array. We start with a bit of state. We will hold our value in a single string and use thesplitmethod to turn it into an array. We will loop over ourCODE_LENGTHjust so we can grab the index and render in our display value. Our display value will be divs that have their border right the same color and size as the wrap. The wrapping div will provide the border look, and the display pieces will provide the separation on the inside. We will use:last-childto remove the border from the last display so we don't have a double border on the right side from the display and wrap border. We also use display flex to allow us to easily center our text content inside of our display. We need to get access to ourinputvia a ref so we can control it's focus. We render our input, and one important piece is to putvalue="""". The reason for this is to indicate to React that it's a controlled input, and that even if people type into we never want to display a value. If we left that off the text input would be uncontrolled and would have user input displayed. Instead of displaying the content in the input we have our value split from state and rendered in separate divs. We will render our input absolutely because we will want to control the movement of it later so that we don’t have to fake a cursor but instead move the input to the active cell. Also we remove the outline and some other default as we will recreate these later with separate styling. On important piece is controlling focus and blur. We will need to track whether or we have focus so we can display appropriate outlines. So we add a booleanfocusedvalue to state, and attach anonFocusandonBlurto our input. Not only that we need to handle what happens when the user clicks on the outer wrap. If it’s clicked we need to focus on the input. So we add anonClickand call focus on ourrefthat we had created earlier. Calling focus directly like this will then trigger ouronFocushandler so we don't need to set any state in thehandleClickmethod. One important piece is moving the input. As the user types we will move it starting from position 0 through to the full length of the code. We do this so as the user types the input can display in the cell with a real cursor flashing. We do some math to determine the selected index to multiply by32which is just the width of each display cell. If our current length of typed in code is less than the total possible values then we return thevalues.lengthwhich is just the length of characters users have typed in. If we hit the point where the user has typed in all possible characters then we just return the total possible length of characters. This limits the input to always be visible in the last square and no further. Now when the user types we will have our change event fire. Generally you would update state withe.target.valuehowever since we put ourvalue=""""the value will always be the singular character that the user typed. We are reference previous state so we need to use the callbacksetStatestyle. Since this will be called later and React cleans up and reuses synthetic events we need to save off the typed in value otherwisee.target.valuewill beundefined. Also thehandleChangemethod could be potentially called with more than one character if the user pasted in the number. So to combat any possibility of over pasting past the maximum character limit we will combine the current state, new incoming value, thensliceit down to the maximum length. If a user pasted in8characters we would grab0to6in our case and only update the state with the first 6 characters. Also if the current length is greater than or equal to maximum code length we return null. This will prevent typing in more than the allowed amount or characters. Accessibility is important to think about and so we will need to re-create the outline that would normally display when the user has focus. We could add in the outline but choose to do it this way for better design/aesthetic purposes. To accomplish this we need to know if a current cell is selected, or if everything is all filled in. If it’s currently selected we want to render our outline, or if all numbers have been filled in then we want to render the outline in the last input. We do that by comparing the index we are looping over directly to the length of the characters that have been typed in. Then to check if it’s filled we compare length of values typed in and also check if the loop has gotten to the final input. We also need to check if the user is currently focused. If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. Thedisplayis positionedrelativeso it will render and cover each individual character display. Then using thebox-shadowstyle we can create that has0offset in bother directions, no blur, but a spread-radius. The spread radius will make a 4px border on the outside of the display. We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from theonKeyUpcallback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can usesliceto remove the last character from ourvalueon state. One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th, but once they type in the final character theselectedIndexwill move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers, the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to theinputso we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. That’s it, we now have an input that auto-progresses whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached.

https://medium.com/@askdroneu/how-dji-became-the-drone-industrys-most-valued-company-526f5bf6141d?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,How DJI Became the Drone Industry’s Most Valued Company,Written byDrone U,"Drone U Follow -- Listen Share DA — Jiang Innovations orDJIis a Shenzen based company with humble origins. Frank Wong funded DJI with his university scholarship money back in 2006. The scenario today, is quite different, to say the least. DJI’s annual sales are estimated at a mammoth $3 billion. And they have nearly 3,000 employees on their roster. As per the latest round of funding in April 2018, DJI is now valued at a cool $15 Billion — which makes Frank the world’s first drone billionaire. So, how has DJI managed to reach this enviable position? Let us segue into our first point — their Chinese origins. Toattribute DJI’s success simply to low production costs courtesy their Chinese production base is a narrow and incorrect view. Sure, low manufacturing costs are a factor — but certainly not the only one. Drone manufacturing is incredibly complicated and requires mastery over production processes such as injection molding and precision machining. Check out this cool video showing the manufacturing process for a drone frame mold: This is what Tim Cook from Apple had to say when he was asked about manufacturing iPhone's in China- “There’s a confusion about China… the popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is, China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view……the reason is because of the skill… and the quantity of skill in one location… and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here”. “There’s a confusion about China… the popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is, China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view… …the reason is because of the skill… and the quantity of skill in one location… and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here”. Clearly, manufacturing of drone parts is also an industry which requires tooling and engineering skills of the highest degree. So while low costs are one of the reasons for DJI’s success, access to skilled labor is an important factor as well. Another strong reason for DJI’s success is their responsiveness to market needs. Mike Winn, co-founder, DroneDeploypoints outthat using the same technology platform for consumer and enterprise solutions allows DJI to innovate and launch new products with lightning speed. So, this allows a Mavic user to have the same user experience when he upgrades to a Matrice — resulting in faster adoption as well. DJI’s recent partnership with Microsoft will allow DJI users access to the Microsoft ecosystem via a SDK. This will permit drone pilots to offer autonomous and scalable industry solutions. Check out this video to learn more: GoPro and DJI certainly make an interesting case study for folks wanting to study market strategy and competition. GoPro, founded in 2002 went public in 2014. Riding on the success of their action cameras, the GoPro stock price touched a high of $87 in October 2014. Today the stock is trading at less than 5 dollars. So what really happened? Arguably, GoPro’s biggest folly was their foray into the drone business — a decision that was fraught with trouble from the get go. After talks of a possible collaboration with DJI and 3DR fell through, GoPro decided to take control of the entire development and manufacturing process. After several delays, Karma was finally launched in late 2016. Citing stiff competition and low margins, GoPro exited the drone business completely in January 2018. In September 2018, GoPro released the Hero 7 which was touted as the “Gimbal Killer”. Well, DJI responded by combining a camera and gimbal to give us the “Osmo Pocket”.Costing $349, the Osmo Pocket is cheaper than theHero 7and gives us much sharper footage. This is what Paul Aitken, Drone U Chief Pilot had to say in his blog post, aptly titled, “SAY GOODBYE TO GOPRO, Family Footage Just Became More Enjoyable Thanks to the OSMO Pocket”. “No, cameras with stabilized sensors are not as smooth as the OSMO pocket.Even cameras that boast a stabilized sensor will not compete with a camera like the Osmo pocket. A stabilized sensor can only correct 15–20 degrees on the roll axis”. “No, cameras with stabilized sensors are not as smooth as the OSMO pocket.Even cameras that boast a stabilized sensor will not compete with a camera like the Osmo pocket. A stabilized sensor can only correct 15–20 degrees on the roll axis”. MOTA CEO, Michael Faro sums up the current market dynamics quite well: “We are not competing with DJI. That corner of the market is filled.” “We are not competing with DJI. That corner of the market is filled.” Last month, in response to the ongoing US-China Trade war, GoPro decided to stop manufacturing cameras for the US market in China. But, how have the trade wars affected DJI? Our good friends at DroneDJreportedthe hike in prices for the Phantom 4 Pro/Adv Remote Controller to $749 in October 2018. Likewise prices for the Mavic 2 Pro were raised from $1,449 to $1,499 in the month of September. Whether this is in response to increased tariffs for Chinese manufactured goods is still open to speculation. ClickHEREfor the entire list of Chinese manufactured products that are subject to increased tariffs. This is whatMario Rebello, VP and Country Manager, North America has to say about the impact of increased tariffs on DJI products: “There has been impact. At times we’ll share the cost, and at times we’ll pass along the costs.” “There has been impact. At times we’ll share the cost, and at times we’ll pass along the costs.” According to Bloomberg, DJI is considering moving to location with less tariff regulations. With primary drone markets like the US experiencing exponential growth, and with countries like India allowing commercial drone operations, there are no signs that the drone market will experience any slowdown in the coming years. In fact, Gartner predicts that the drone market will touch $11 billion by 2020. A strong R & D department and a nimble production line means that DJI is well poised to capture this growth. A willingness to work on wafer thin margins also makes it difficult for new competition to find a firm footing in the market. (It is estimated that DJI made a net profit of $120 million on sales of $1 billion in 2014)@TheDroneGirlreported that DJI’s market share has gone up from 72% in 2017 to 74% in 2018. In 2018, DJI delighted drone users by launching theRonin S, theMavic 2, thePhantom 4 RTKand the Osmo Pocket. According to industry rumors, DJI shall be announcing a newMatrice seriesat CES 2019. There has also been much speculation surroundingTerra, a trademark which was recently registered by DJI. DJI started a new company, DJI Terra B.V. based in Netherlands.

The challenges they seem to encounter in different markets makes it a very interesting company to watch and the unique solutions they often come up to better adapt to local conditions, at-least in my eyes, show why they are a market leader in the transportation industry. At this stage I believe their strategy has evolved to trying to become a marketplace for transportation that gets you from point A to point B regardless of the mode of transportation. So be it through an electric scooter or a bus, the vision is that Uber would be the go to platform to get such transportation. What I find quite intriguing and inline with the aforementioned strategy is the recent launch of Uber Bus in Egypt and how a similar initiative would be aptly suited for the Southern African market. As someone who has studied, worked and lived in South Africa I understand that the impact of such a launch on the South African market would be significant to say the least. Close to 70% of all private transportation of individuals is through the minibus taxi industry. These minibus taxis are largely informal, have a designated route and pick up people from anywhere between the point where the route begins and where it ends. Customers pay in cash and taxis often drive recklessly and take detours to compete for clients, making it difficult for passengers to predict arrival times. People use this as a mode of transportation for everyday travel for both leisure and getting to and from work. According to the South African National Taxi Council, taxis transport about 15 million commuters daily, if we assume the average fare is R15 (thumb-suck) then we can put the size of the industry at around R82 billion. Assuming a smartphone penetration of 35% (Pew Research puts it at 51%, but the numbers could be skewed by smartphone users who have more than one smartphone) this would put the total addressable market for ride hailing in the taxi industry at around R28.4 billion (5.2 million commuters a day), presenting an obviously an amazing opportunity for Uber or any other player with the gall and capital to invest in an Uber Taxi type alternative. Understandably one of the biggest concerns with trying to step into the taxi industry’s turf is the likely backlash from the taxi industry. Historically, the launching of transportation options that potentially disrupt the taxi industry has created a lot of friction that has manifested in the form of violence. In many cases this has been averted through partnerships with the Taxi industry. Projects such as the MyCiti (bus rapid transit service in Cape Town) and the Gautrain averted these issues by through dialogue with taxi associations. For example, the launch of MyCiti in Cape Town involved Transport for Cape Town (TCT) buying out operating permits for taxi drivers operating in the City Bowl area with drivers receiving significant payouts as a result of this, limited permit buyouts in townships. This model drastically reduced potential conflict. Similarly, Uber/Taxify could approach the matter by looking to form a partnership with a select few Taxi companies that operate routes and has taxis that are in excellent condition in areas that are suburban areas or areas close to the metropolitan that are more heavily populated with working age middle-class demographics (according to FNB’s retail segment data this includes anyone earning a gross salary of between R7000 — R60000 per month) that are heavily populated with the objective of targeting the market segment that lies in the middle-class, uses taxis to get to work and have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. I would assume that this is the demographic that would most likely already know the brand, have a high smartphone penetration and a higher employment rate (they need to get to work on a daily basis). For this pilot program; i.) These taxis would operate only during peak hours; when people are going to work and when people are coming back from work to test market demand for this solution during the times people are most likely to need transportation and to understand whether this has the potential to actually grow the taxi market- so will this attract users who would in normal circumstances not take a taxi ii.) Using Cape Town as an example, it would only operate in residential areas such as Sea Point, Green Point, Mouille Point and take them to work either in the CBD or Century City with a few ‘partner taxis’ that are already designated to operate in those particular routes. This would presumably minimise the risk of backlash from the taxi industry and help build a case study to show how a partnership with an on-demand platform such as Uber could actually help Taxis increase their revenue. iii.) The taxis would travel during select pre-determined times for example 7:00, 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning and 16:00, 17:00 and 18:00 iv.) Users would be able to pre-book their seats for each ride and pay for the ride through the Uber App. Cash would not be an option. The taxi would then pick the user up from their location with the intention of taking them to their respective locations. The idea behind this would be to show partner taxis the convenience of an Uber partnership- eliminating the inconvenience of keeping change and cash v.) The taxis would pick up users from the locations they pre-book the seats from vi.) If the project is sufficiently capitalised the cost for travellers could initially be subsidised to aggressively drive demand. The added benefits and convenience of this services (getting picked up from your location and getting dropped off where you work) would warrant a higher fare than a typical taxi. The rate of the fare could be dependent on; i.) initial waiting time -the longer you make the taxi wait for you the more you delay other people so there is a strong need to add an incentive to ensure that passengers do not take too long to board the taxi ii.) the distance you want to travel For the customer this could; lower transportation costs and make regular Uber travel an option for a new set of customers who cannot necessarily afford a private Uber car on a daily basis, reduce uncertainty over arrival times because the taxi would have a pre-set schedule to pick up x amount of people and it would be possible to make arrival time predictions with some degree of accuracy (factoring in waiting times), this would in turn presumably reduce reckless driving from the driver which is normally caused by the driver trying to race for more customers and maximise her earnings per trip. For the taxi driver the advantages would be increased profitability per trip and more revenue certainty per trip. At-least during the pilot phase, the same taxis could then proceed to operate as normal after serving their Uber clients, limiting the risk of any loss of revenue on their part. The objective of this pilot would be to; i.) Build a case-study to show how an Uber partnership would help taxis increase their profitability per trip, showing how desirable such a partnership would be to companies that own taxis or taxi associations (according to Qualcomm there are about 330 taxi associations using over360k minibuses). This case study would be used to persuade more taxis to partner with Uber with the intention of scaling into other areas populated with working age middle-class demographics. ii.) Show that Uber would not cannibalise the existing taxi market. To decrease potential friction between the taxis industry and Uber. If the Uber Taxi charges a premium on its services and requires a smartphone and a bank account in order to pre-book a seat. This would limit the target audience to people who have access to such things. While the profitability of a route could be important, I believe this pilot would be geared towards not just tapping into existing taxi customers who have the means to pre-book a seat, it has the ability to introduce new set of customers to the market- customers who would under normal circumstances, not have taken a taxi to go to work. Interestingly a somewhat similar partnership has been tested byAftaRobotwith the Johannesburg Southern Suburbs Taxi Association, which allows users to ‘make a pickup request, and know when and where they’ll get a ride, making it easier for drivers to know where to pick up passengers, making their routes more clear and reducing the need to drive frantically to compete for passengers. The other pertinent question might be around operating permits, minibuses can only operate within designated routes. To address this issue, passengers could potentially be dropped off at a designated drop off point.",Emmanuel Sibanda,https://medium.com/@emmanuelsibanda?source=post_page---byline--c1872b2b239a---------------------------------------,0,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg,2019-01-03T19:31:41.019Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@saxberg/internet-of-things-shaping-our-future-today-f4d33b1534b3?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,Internet of Things — shaping our future today,Written byNatasha F Saxberg,"Natasha F Saxberg Follow -- 1 Listen Share Internet of Things (IoT) is a well known buzzword, many people might have heard about for a couple of decades. At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies, platforms, and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives, since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting, anything from cars, jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED. Industry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future, from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology, the key interaction will be human, since IoT objects will not only be connected to things, but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions, remotely control a robot, perform heart surgery in a refugee camp, or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available, smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of 1.5 billion units shipped in 2016, up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there, shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing, enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things. INTERNET OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE HOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS HUMANS, BUT ENFORCE A CHANGE IN MOST POWER STRUCTURES AS WE KNOW THEM, FROM DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITY. Through 4,5/5G and IPv6 we are entering a reality where the world will consist of a giant network of connected “things”, shaping the future of work, facilities, and megacities. In this era, we will not only see a change in our use of technology, but in most of the structures and organisations, we know today. We will need a systemic upgrade to support our exponentially intelligent future, from the power structures of politics, democracy, and geographical borders to how we educate and the future of organisations. THE IOT STACKIoT is not only technology, but a paradigm, from protocols, hardware to software. To understand IoT, one must understand the IoT Stack, and the maturity of the layers. This Thing Stack consists of three layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms. Sensors are embedded in objects or the physical environment to capture information and events for your company. Microcontrollers and internet connectivity share information captured by sensors within your IoT objects and act based on this information to change the environment. Through aggregation and analysis of data, service platforms cater to your customers. The platforms also control your IoT product’s end-to-end experience, enable your customers to define system rules and update firmware. The defintion of IoT is the use of intelligently connected devices and systems that can leverage data gathered by embedded sensors and operators in machines and other physical objects. In other word things that can connect and process data connected with a network. As an example a pen with a RFID tag is not IoT, because it does not connect to anything and it does not process data — it can be used as an element in an IoT solution but more intelligence is needed to be captured under the IoT umbrella. IOT WILL CHANGE OUR WORLDThe world as we know it today will change dramatically, and we all play an essential part in cultivating this future as business professionals whether we work with startups, corporations or in the public sector. I will publish a series on future scenarios of IoT, how leading innovators and companies are developing IoT solutions affecting us now as well as in the future, to inspire others who are working with emerging technologies and/or who also possess a curious mind.",Natasha F Saxberg,https://medium.com/@saxberg?source=post_page---byline--f4d33b1534b3---------------------------------------,60,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*xBU1pF1K6jTA3jMoSnzUig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*xBU1pF1K6jTA3jMoSnzUig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*xBU1pF1K6jTA3jMoSnzUig.jpeg,2019-01-01T21:02:56.671Z,Medium

Shipping Lines, Forwarders, Terminal Operators, etc have salivated at the possibility of having such a predictable and efficient network, where import containers can go directly to the nearest exporter’s place without having to go to empty yards, where significant time is lost in finding the next trip. Now, with improving visibility and formal data collection finally taking place in the segment, this dream is getting closer to becoming a reality. Containers going from an importer’s chemical factory to an exporter’s FMCG plant while getting cleared by a relayed container surveyor is becoming a reality! The, march towards this future is beginning with players trying to conquer certain clusters where they have visibility and control. So, during this early adopter stage, the various stakeholders are all entering the realm in different methods vying for the same outcome: an expansion in the space where they can directly cater to the freight owners, by connecting imports and exports in a single direct chain. In a country where more than 85% of long-haul freight moves by road transportation, the natural 1st layer elongation into the extended logistics segment is road logistics. These days’ road logistics is shifting towards efficient road optimization, where the truck can be optimized, while meeting predicted schedules. Thus the various stakeholders’ are looking to build their own lane cluster’s on routes they are familiar with, where they have a strong network and operational control. Operational control and a logistics network are the keys to operating a successful end to end logistics program, where additional cargo can be handled without significantly increasing costs. These lane clusters will be won over by the stakeholder’s who start controlling both the inward and outward flow of goods from a seaport/dry port on key routes. By having operational control and visibility of the lane cluster the provider can increase the value provided to the customer by offering more lucrative rates through efficiency gains. Until another player gains control and visibility of the route to provide better efficiency, other’s will not be able to play at the same price point, thus the likelihood of a shipper staying with the single provider will start growing on pure value terms more than relational terms. Different stakeholders in the space have had their own methods of entering the space based on the prior core operational strengths. But, they all are looking to build their road transportation clusters: Some examples of prominent formerly niche players building their networks are the following: Shipping Lines-Lines are trying to provide door to door services on certain routes where they have presence and comfort. They are offering to take a box from Dubai to an importer on India’s West Coast, on a transport route they are familiar with. This door to door service is predictable. But rather than just ending the E2E process they are doing container triangulation by themselves so the container is re-positioned to the nearest exporter/empty park location immediately. On certain West Coast route’s lines have built their clusters in such a way they are able to immediately reposition the container directly from the importer’s factory to the exporter’s factory (without going to the empty park) thus saving a significant amount of time and fuel finding another customer that needs a container. A line attempting to move a container directly from an importer’s factory to an exporter’s factory requires tremendously visibility and control of a route, thus lines are only focusing on lanes where they have enough demand visibility of both import and export. Shipping Agencies-Some large shipping agencies are starting to enter the Indian transportation segment by taking vehicles on a dry lease, where they are continually finding cargo to ensure at profitable vehicle utilization. Unless there are direct volume commitments, the lease model tends to be the riskiest. So, a strong understanding of the movement of goods on certain clusters is required. The lease model only really works if the operator knows: Monthly frequency of movements from locations on the route Size of Shipments Average Turnaround Time Destination The benefit of this model is its ability to provide strong control of transporters to the stakeholder, so the problem of availability of trucks reduces. If rapid expansion on clusters is desired, this model can be successful, as control of the truck allows the stakeholder to reposition in the truck to an exporter. Effectively this model can allow complete inward and outward movements control on key route clusters and may even allow for potential cargo diversions from other ports as 100% utilization routes can be controlled. Terminal Operators- Terminal Operators are looking to expand their footprint by building cargo community networks that are connected to individual route clusters These trade community networks collaborate with Port Community System’s, where the ecosystem can interact and share information. This process makes it easier to file manifests. This integrated system also helps customers located on key routes have access to services in a single window. For example, Pondicherry cluster is near Chennai Port Trust. From the portal, the Pondicherry customers can take quotations and can file clearances and on the cargo community network. Besides transportation, this additional service from the local terminal operator eases the work of local customers and can help increase choices when selecting services, as transporters, CHA’s and other service providers can be cross-compared on the trade network that is linked with the local PCS. Since container shipping began in 1947, providers have always talked about door to door service, where a shipper can book a container and it is delivered by the single stakeholder arranging and providing all services seamlessly. Service providers are getting closer and closer to that future as they are powerful companies in the logistics chain with a strong global presence. Building key transportation clusters have been the start to such a future. Only, now with growing transportation visibility and machine learning predictability has such a model become possible. Matching imports and exports on core routes have always been about having options in connecting pairs. These flexible options in connecting pairs are critical as predictable vehicle turnaround time is crucial in reducing uncertainty and in getting this model to work. With options in connecting pairs, it becomes possible to connect a trip to a large importers place to small exporter A, small exporter B, or small exporter C. The power of historical data also provides the “best exporter/importer pick” based on previous turnaround time and truck performance. This optimal pick model is what can make this successful. So, just like how uber or airbnb have very accurate algorithms in their spaces, the logistics players with the deepest visibility on their routes, will take it all and become the single service provider, where they directly connect import cargo owners to export cargo owners in a single move.",Shorjoe Bhattacharya,https://medium.com/@shorjoe/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--1ac9cd16cbdb---------------------------------------,11,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg,2019-01-11T15:23:22.776Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@parismarx/is-apples-cash-cow-in-trouble-9215f813ee8b?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,Is Apple’s Cash Cow In Trouble?,Reality distortion field in full swing over iPhone slowdown,"Reality distortion field in full swing over iPhone slowdown Paris Marx Follow -- 5 Listen Share Yesterday, trading of Apple’s stock was briefly paused for CEO Tim Cook to deliver some bad, but not wholly unexpected, news: revenue in Q1 2019 would fall far short of expectations, in large part due to slow iPhone sales. Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR, XS, and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected, and now that’s been confirmed. When Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers, it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue, in particular, so much lower than expected? In Cook’sletter to investors, he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets, in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years, and now theissues with Apple’s product lineare coming back to bite it. Any slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted fornearly 63 percent of the company’s revenuein fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters, Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless. In explaining the lower iPhone revenues, Cook blames lower carrier subsidies, a stronger US dollar, and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company inan interview with CNBCwhen it was actually a response toa massive scandalover slowing down batteries in older iPhones. While these things may have contributed to lower sales, they miss the bigger challenge that Apple is facing with the iPhone line, and the way Cook completely ignores it in his letter illustrates how the reality distortion field is still in full swing among Apple executives, and could ultimately be hindering them from addressing the real problem. In that same interview with CNBC, Cook says that carrier are offering lower subsidies, so for customers who have been out of the market for two to three years and are returning to get a new phone, everythinglooksmore expensive. Except phones don’t justlookmore expensive, theyaremore expensive. Apple has been slowly increasing the price of iPhones for years, to the point where the cheapest of its new models now costs $749, but there are also base models for $999 and $1099 — higher prices area trend across the whole product line. These prices are in large part a response to the significant decline in iPhone sales growth as the smartphone markets in the United States and China has become saturated. Since sales growth has stalled, average selling price needs to increase to keep overall revenue growing — but even that seems to be becoming a challenge. Despite the issues cited in China, Cook says all-time revenue records were set in the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. The company has stopped reporting sales numbers, but it’s safe to assume this is a result of higher revenue from its premium phones — the iPhone XS and XS Max — not due to selling many more phones over last year. Apple is the iPhone. Sure, its other product lines are doing well, but none comes nearly as close to matching the size and importance to Apple’s bottom line. The company has so far avoided its reckoning with the state of the smartphone market by raising prices, but that strategy is already catching up to it. Even though Cook placed the blame elsewhere, there can be no doubt that higher iPhone prices are a contributing factor to the slowdown; it’s getting harder and harder to justify an upgrade, and raising prices again isn’t going to make it any easier.",Paris Marx,https://medium.com/@parismarx?source=post_page---byline--9215f813ee8b---------------------------------------,193,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg,2019-01-03T15:36:10.283Z,Medium

Cook,"Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share While you may or may not need to wind thread on a regular basis, this hack by Mr. Innovative will show you how it can be done automatically. The device uses a motor to turn a 3D-printed spool at high speed, pulling thread from a much larger spool positioned vertically at the other end of the assembly. To keep things threaded evenly, a feeding arm is rotated back and forth using a servo. As the thread travels through the assembly, it spins an encoder disk that allows it to sense just how much thread is applied to the smaller roller. AnArduino Unois used for controlling the machine, along with a custom PCB shield. User interface is provided by a small OLED display that shows thread length, as well as a rotary encoder with a pushbutton input. The device features a manual winding mode, plus a mode that enables it to wind a predefined length of thread. The circuit and code for the buildcan be found here, and print files arelisted on Thingiverse. Parts used are available in the video description if you’d like to create your own, or perhaps you could apply something seen here to your next project!",Jeremy S.

https://medium.com/@BSzabo24/apple-has-more-than-my-money-296b3d00fe49?source=tag_archive---------129-----------------------,Apple Has More Than My Money,Written byBen Szabo,"Ben Szabo Follow -- 1 Listen Share It’s funny that our most material things control the most important aspects of our lives. Cracked phone screen? Worst thing ever. Hard drive corrupted? Day ruined. We rely more heavily on our technology each and every day. My devices are a part of me and have attached themselves at my hip for more reasons than one. Full disclosure, I’ve had Apple devices for the last 7 years, andI just recently purchased a new iPhone. When Apple released the first iPhone nearly 12 years ago, they kickstarted a new platform and method of keeping their customer base from switching to any other device, convenience. We constantly look for convenience in everyday life, which trains to take to work, ordering food ahead, or basically anyone who has an Amazon Prime account. Apple has captured that idea in every product they’ve released in the last decade preventing users from going to their competitors. Timeout, let’s be clear, there is actually nothing preventing one Apple customer from a switch to say, a Samsung device or the new Google Pixel 3. For the most part, there are extremely capable and much more affordable devices out there without a fruit logo that will do just fine. But Apple does it’s best to bring you in as a user once and knows that it likely won’t have to do much to keep you there. Unbox Therapymentioned this recently while discussing the limitations Apple has created for itself in Asian markets with no “budget” smartphone options. Apple customers are stuck on that early innovation that Apple found in the early 2000s. They are still riding on that iTunes, iPod, original iPhone wave that has led us to devices like the iPhone XS and the iPad Pro. There is a familiarity and convenience to those features and devices that we still appreciate today. The simple Apple icons, the familiar glass back and aluminum band devices, and above all, iOS has become so nostalgic, that it can feel foreign to switch to another device. Apple has roped in many of us, including myself, and they do this meticulously and intentionally. For example, most Apple products, only work with Apple products. Your Apple Watch can only sync up to an iPhone, and Apple Music will only work within the Apple Music app. The Apple Homepod only works with another Apple device in your home, exclusively uses Siri, and might be thedumbest smart speakerout there. Apple AirPods, while brilliant, only work with mobile Apple devices. The exclusivity mixed in with intentionally limiting software encourages users to never let go of that shiny white logo. Once you go Apple, there is very little incentive to go back to anything else. Once you go Apple, there is very little incentive to go back to anything else. Apple has created an ecosystem around their products, and this explains the phenomenon surrounding Apple user experience. In lamens terms, this means that Apple products almost force the user into using other Apple products, the hardware, software and key features of the devices require other Apple products to take full advantage of. This creates a sort of bubble that the user can’t escape from but can only make larger by purchasing more Apple products. It’s a trap, that limits a user’s experience. It basically allows all the features of a competitive smartphone, smart-device, smart speaker, or watch, without being able to use any of the other competitors. This is one of the largest drivers of smartphone choice right up there with battery life and price point. Any user can justify any flaw in a device if it lines up with their already existing cloud and keychain (see what I did there) of information. I would go as far to say, the number one reason an iPhone user continues to buy another iPhone or any other Apple product is that of the convenience of the Apple ecosystem. I know that is why I’ve continued this trend. Its convenience is most often countered by its limitations of that convenience. I don’t have some scathing review of this idea either. I mean, I’m stuck in the Apple ecosystem, I am aware of my entrapment, and I don’t feel the need to complain about it. It is genius. Apple has given me no reason to switch, I’m already hooked. They’ve got me, and they’ve probably got you too. With that being said, fewer people are upgrading to the newest flagship devices.Apple reportedly stopped sharing sales figuresbecause the rate at which people are upgrading their devices has steeply declined. It took me nearly three years to upgrade from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone XR and about six years to upgrade my MacBook Pro. Users seem to be fine sticking with their two-year-old device as long as it saves all their passwords, apps, information, contacts, and so on. They find little need to upgrade their device to the latest model let alone switch to a completely different manufacturer. While shopping for new devices I absolutely looked at the Google Pixel, OnePlus 6T, and the new Microsoft Surface book. But the thought of migrating all my files, passwords and emails to a new OS was truly so off-putting that I just had to go back to Apple. The limitations of Apple devices are as egregiously apparent as they are intentional. Our devotion to our devices and our ecosystems is matched only by the convenience and openness of those platforms. As companies like Google begin to grow their ecosystems with Google Home and the success of the Google Pixel, we may see more competition within smartphone user dedication. But I know that there would have to be one hell of a deal, on a phenomenal device to wean me off my addiction/commitment to the Apple ecosystem.",Ben Szabo,https://medium.com/@BSzabo24?source=post_page---byline--296b3d00fe49---------------------------------------,4,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg,2019-01-03T20:55:16.782Z,Medium

That’s the idea behind theStereoPi— a carrier board, which can also be used for computer vision, drone, and robot projects. The open source board is compatible with all Compute Modules (1, 3,3+) and runs Raspbian right out of the box. The StereoPi boasts a pair of CSI camera ports (supporting OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras), micro USB port, micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports, 1X USB header, HDMI, Ethernet, SO-DIMM connector, 5V power connector, on/off power switch, boot mode jumper, and a 40-pin GPIO header — all packed into a 90 x 40mm footprint. The StereoPi is versatile and has already been employed in some real world applications — such as pairing it with anOculus Riftto render people in a third-person view, using it withROSfor simple depth-mapping, andstitching360-degree panoramic images. Of course, the StereoPi can be used for a myriad of other applications, like building computer vision systems with OpenCV, live streaming video directly to YouTube from drone and robotic platforms, and even creating your own augmented and virtual reality systems. Beyond Raspbian and ROS, the board can be programmed using Python, C, and C++, depending on the project. The StereoPi isn’t yet available, however a batch of them have entered pre-production and have been thoroughly tested, which means they will go on to post-production shortly and will soon appear onCrowd Supply. UPDATE:StereoPi’s campaign has now launched on Crowd Supply, starting at $69 for the ‘slim edition’ and $89 for the ‘standard’ board.

During my years in high-school I had one of the coolest jobs a teenager could have, I worked part-time at the local magic shop. The shop was more than just a shop. It was a workshop where magic tricks and larger stage illusions were created and sold to professionals. While I loved and still love magic, my journey lied in technology. Recently, I had the pleasure to combine my two loves. A quick search on YouTube revealed tricks using mobile phones, but I didn’t find any using a smart watch. I knew that the idea of using a less assuming device such as a watch could potentially create a more compelling effect. I decided to create a magic trick anyone could perform using their Samsung smart watch. Why the Samsung watch? Because it’s the one I own and one that allowed me to combine my other love for web-stack technologies. My first app idea involves the magician showing an audience member several ESP symbols and asking them to select one. The same symbol appears on the magician’s watch face. I built the app and a couple of weeks later, Magic: ESP Test was available in the Samsung Galaxy app store. I later had an idea for a card trick that allows the magician to ask a volunteer to chose a card and to then have the card appear in a smart watch. This is particularly effective because the participant believes they’re freely choosing a card and that card then appears in the watch. The effect can be repeated with a different card appearing each time. I went on to create a few other apps, some a bit less magical but still entertaining. For now, I’ve turned some of my hobby time attention back to traditional game development. I’m currently building a game engine designed for the Samsung Gear S2, S3, Sport and Galaxy smart watches. My first game, Tyros, is scheduled for a late January release. — Thanks for reading! If you like what you read, hold the clap button below so that others may find this.

The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.” - Walter Benjamin,Theses on the Philosophy of History I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists, as the theme presupposes, as the themevehemently desires) because the word is, in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination, aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before, when I was still in advertising, the rallying call was always to innovate (products, mediums, taglines, points-of-purchase, packaging designs, greeting cards, literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put, everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate, ceaselessly and relentlessly, across all disciplines and all positions, and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years, I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation, to the point that not only has it become nonsensical, in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly, automatically, and fervently, but also tortuous in its endlessness. As a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out, in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically. Innovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century, from the Latininnovat- ‘renewed, altered’ from the verbinnovare, fromin- ‘into’ +novare‘make new’ (fromnovus‘new’).² Interestingly, it was first used as a kind of invective, one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules, and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were, contextually, undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures. It was a combination of the scientific turn, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “definedinventionas an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import, whileinnovationhappens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here, economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention, and up until now, we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit, because then it would be similar to art, which, while uplifting, is not financially remunerative. Or, if you would like to state it in another way, you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art, but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation. Fast forward to 1991, wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition, but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes), at ever greater rates of turnover, now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic, and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words, there really is nothing new about the new, or the way we think about the new. In fact, we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing onAngelus Novus, which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft, more intolerable, and more alienated to real human conditions, than the present that births it. Where does this leave us then, on the question of innovation and its supposed elevation? Let me propose some initial observations, which I hope might be food for thought in at least the next few moments: First, that as a concept, innovation has been regurgitating its own logic since the 1800s; therefore, there’s nothing really innovative about it. All of its functions, its strategies, and its consequent maneuvers, have been apparent centuries ago, but its genius lies in the way that we continue to fall for the utopic myth it has been made to represent.⁶ If one would like to “elevate” the idea of innovation (elevate, from the Latinelevat- ‘raised’; from the verbelevare —frome-(variant ofex-) ‘out, away’ +levare‘lighten’ (fromlevis‘light’)⁷, then one must first grapple with the fact that historically, nineteenth century businessmen have already “raised” the idea. Innovation is already a cultural dominant, and you would be hard pressed to find a concept more favored, or more generative of interest from all business sectors. One needs to ask, what are we elevating innovation from, and is it even necessary at this point? Innovation is already the star of the show and the world is its captive audience; what more can we possibly do for it, and does it really need to be magnified even more? Second, and implicit to this whole argument is the function of history and the genealogy of ideas. Echoing Jameson, the way we work has blurred temporal categories so much so that it seems like we are living in an eternal present, willing to deny the function of history in our everyday lives. Ahistoricity, while easy to appropriate, is riddled with ignorance and only produces short-term successes and a whole host of invisible long-term failures. Innovation, which I do not doubt must still be delivered at the end of the day, no matter how suspicious I might be of the idea, can only benefit from analyses with alongue duréein mind. Whether we are talking about the innovation of a product, a campaign, a marketing strategy, or like this article somewhat hastily attempts, theinnovation of innovationitself, the capacity to think about an object as a product of time can only be generative of insight, which is a rare but truly beautiful thing nowadays. So if there is any piece of advice I can only hope to propose and with which to end this article with, it is that one try to think of things historically, in as many ways as one can. While this project might not guarantee you financial and material compensation, it does provide, in a way, a kind of personal elevation. ¹ Supposedly the punchline to a series of running gags featured on the popular Philippine FM station, 101.1 Yes FM, in the Philippines. On a good day, sometimes the joke will be funny. On a bad day, there will be no joke, only the punchline on repeat, which might be its own joke altogether. ²English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “innovate.”https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/innovate ³ Emma Green, “Innovation: The History of a Buzzword,”The Atlantic, June 20, 2013.https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/innovation-the-history-of-a-buzzword/277067/ ⁴ Ibid. ⁵ Fredric Jameson, “The Logic of Late Capitalism,” inPostmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism(Durham: Duke University Press, 1991), 4, 16. ⁶ This point does not attempt to detract from the myriad number of ways innovation continues to have a function in our lives. Take for example, the rise of the internet and the way it has redefined our conception of work. The digital network is still a product of late capital, it is still mainly a function of our desire to reap more profit by collapsing our ideas of time and space (everything should be quicker, faster, and should have a more global reach, etcetera etcetera), but definitely the paradigms by which we enact this logic are not similar to the those lived by seventeenth century peasants, the monarchists, the industrialists, or the other numerous historical demographics that have either risen or fallen in the past two centuries. ⁷English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “elevate.”https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/elevate.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/storytelling-for-engineers-vol-2-dac768c567e1?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,Storytelling for Engineers — Vol.2,Give me the exec summary,"Stefano Mosconi Follow HackerNoon.com -- Listen Share Every time I was going to my boss I would get the same answer: “Don’t come to me with problems, come to me with solutions”. I would get so frustrated because I thought I was going with solutions… for the love of god I am an engineer! I’m a master at exactly that:solving problems. I would tweak the slides a little bit, take stuff away, VERY IMPORTANT stuff that apparently wasn’t understood and then go back. Same story. I would have to go back again and again, countless times. Frustration kept mounting and I used to get mad at “the others”. Until I started understanding that the problem wasn’t “the others” but it was me. More specifically:the way I was presenting things. As engineers we get in love with the details, we get in love with the technology and the inner workings of the world. Like any good watchmaker we know how clocks work and could spend hours talking about the cogs and the levers that are inside a watch. Watches are fashion items though. Nobody in their right mind would talk about the cogs and the levers if they wanted to sell a watch to anyone. Everyone would talk about the quadrant, the leather wristband, the price. Very few have the time to put into understanding the details and even if they had probably it wouldn’t help you very much to sell your idea. Give me the exec summary So here’s the executive summary:Technology is flooding the world of businessand tech guys and girls (i.e.youthat are reading this) are more and more needed to make business work. What sucks is that on average tech people are not very good at presenting things in a way that everyone else “on the other side” would understand them. Because of this decisions are taken without apparently really listening to the tech guys. And it sucks. Big Time. How do I know? I know because I sucked at doing this myself. That’s when I started to realize I really needed to get better at telling stories. Since I am an engineer I needed a framework, something to make my life easier when building presentations. Something logic. Something that would make sense. At the beginning was a bullet point list I started to study the art of presenting with the hope I could extract thesciencefrom it and understand the things that were behind the most successful presenters. I started working with a bullet point list, a pretty simple one: - Opening - Body - Conclusion That made a lot of sense but many things were left out. I added a few more things on the side: - Key message - Audience - Occasion Sometimes I would start from the Audience, sometimes from the occasion. Sometimes I just wanted to focus on the key message first. Other times the opening was the thing that sparked my creative vein (assuming that I had one :D ). A bullet point list wasn’t cutting it. It was too constraining, too sequential, too limiting. So I thought to build a mind map. But again it was just a bullet list on steroids, too dispersive… I couldn’t have everything under control at once. That’s when I saw the “Business Model Generation” book on my table and I thought: “Hey what if I use a Canvas?” And that’s pretty much how it started working by itself (thanks Alex!). Then it turned into a canvas With the Presentation Design Canvas I could think at everything and write the script of the speech pretty much right away. In 20 minutes I could jot down the main things and stop staring at the powerpoint for hours. It saved me a gazillion of time. You can see the Presentation Design Canvas below and download the PDF high-res versionhere. This Canvas is condensing years of work, study and experiences into an A4. It’s a tool and like any tool it really depends on you to learn how to use it. Like a hammer once you have this everything will start to look like a nail. Even this blog post was first conceived on the Canvas itself. It’s a tool to send messages and prepare yourself to withstand a crowd. It helps you think about the key areas that often you forget to think about. It increases your empathy because it helps you be in other’s shoes. And as a plusit’s freaking logical:) Do me a favour I hope that with this engineers around the world will be more and more able to tell stories to everyone, regardless of their tech prowess. Because it sucks to not be understood. That feeling is something that I personally hated so much that I needed to do something about it. It’s not just for engineersof course, it works great with every type of person but as an engineer I know that I really needed this and I know that people like me really appreciate it. If you like this idea, please do me a favour and share it around, like it and send the link to a friend that needs it, if you share the link above I will be able to know who has downloaded it and grow the community using it. Thank you! 🙏 This is a follow-upto another post I wrote a couple of year ago, that is how long it took me to come up with a solution to that problem :)",Stefano Mosconi,https://medium.com/@stezz?source=post_page---byline--dac768c567e1---------------------------------------,135,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*1Gee4NPRokZ1YNUf.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*1Gee4NPRokZ1YNUf.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*1Gee4NPRokZ1YNUf.jpeg,2019-01-02T13:58:12.496Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@trkkmlynk/how-touchscreens-work-1b2d9a995c4b?source=tag_archive---------130-----------------------,How touchscreens work,Written byTarık,"Tarık Follow -- 1 Listen Share Did you know that there is 7 types of touchscreens? A touchscreen has the ability to detect a touch within the given display area. It is made up of 3 basic elements, a sensor, a controller and a software driver. All the variants of touchscreen technology carry their own distinctive characteristics, with individual benefits and limitations. If you push your finger on the screen and it collapses slightly, then it means it’s resistive. And you’re in big trouble. There are two plates under the screen that are not too close but not too far to each other and a continuous electric current passes through them. When you press your finger on the screen above, the two plates touch each other(not in an NSFW way) and the electric current at that point changes. And after that, the software does its job. These types of phones don’t care what type of pressure you apply, they work on their own. If you don’t believe me, go ahead, buy one. These phones don’t care about you so much that they have the possibility of sending love letters to your crush on their own. Stay a mile away from these. Commonly used for industrial purposes, capacitive phones don’t work with pressure, they work with anything that transmits electric currents or receives. In these types of phones, there is something like a grill that’s either made of copper or indium tin oxide. When we touch the screen, the current between the stylus and the grill is made. The rest is up to the software. It’s best to stay away from these too unless you love touching your phone with a big pencil instead of your thumb. SAW touch screen technology is based upon two transducers and a reflector placed on the glass surface. The waves are scattered across the screen by bouncing off the reflector form and received by the transducers. The touch is detected when the waves are absorbed. In comparison with the other touch screens; SAW provides superior clarity, resolution, and durability, with the ability to interact with a stylus or gloves. Unlike the other types, infrared touchscreen technology does not incorporate an overlay. Instead, a frame surrounding the display consists of LEDs on one side and phototransistor detectors on the other. The phototransistors detect an absence of light and relay a signal that determines the coordinates. The touch is identified and located at the point of interruption of the LED beams. Commonly used in outdoor locations, infrared touch screens are durable and can detect any input. Using optical sensors to recognize the touch, this touchscreen technology is popular for its versatility and scalability. Optical imaging relies on infrared lights. Two infrared imaging sensors are positioned at the top, which doubles up as emitters and retroreflective tapes at the three sides. The emitted lights are reflected back to the imaging sensors, which become blocked at the point of touch and create a shadow to locate the touch. Because optical touchscreens don’t use electrical currents, they can be activated using any object. A finger, gloved finger, stylus are all great input devices for an optical touchscreen. Your breath is also good because this phone can detect it. An APR touch screen is made up a glass overlay and four transducers attached to the back exterior. When the screen is touched, the friction creates acoustic waves. The transducers detect the acoustic wave, which is then converted into a signal. APR touch screens are water resistant, durable and scalable.",Tarık,https://medium.com/@tarikthefirst?source=post_page---byline--1b2d9a995c4b---------------------------------------,108,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg,2019-01-03T15:55:49.085Z,Medium

Presumably this is because PewDiePie’s #1 spot has been threatened by Indian rival T-Series, so loyal fans have been resorting to potentially less legal means of attracting new subscribers. The most recent hack dubbed #CastHack exploits vulnerable Google Chromecasts, smart TVs and Google Homes by renaming devices “HACKED_SUB2PEWDS_#” and by displaying unauthorized video that both notifies the victim of their vulnerability as well as encouraging them to subscribe to PewDiePie. CastHack is the work of the hacker duo HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r. The same duo behind another recent hack that occurred back in November which forced tens of thousands of printers to print paper that encouraged people to subscribe to PewDiePie. The duo maintain though that their hacks are more about exposing vulnerabilities than about either promoting PewDiePie or harming anyone. “We’re only trying to protect you and inform you of this [vulnerability] before someone takes real advantage of it.” “We’re only trying to protect you and inform you of this [vulnerability] before someone takes real advantage of it.” HackerGiraffe even condemned the actions of those who hacked the Wall Street Journal to promote PewDiePie. “The Wall Street[_Journal_] one was harmful and goes against what we stand for” “The Wall Street[_Journal_] one was harmful and goes against what we stand for” For anyone affected by the hack the best way to fix it as confirmed by both Google and HackerGiraffe is “Disable UPnP on your router, and if you’re port forwarding ports 8008/8443/8009 then STOP forwarding them.” This is because this is a router exploit, it takes advantage of incorrectly set up routers.

https://medium.com/@riccardo.dawson/here-we-are-yourkeys-dc6568dc49d0?source=tag_archive---------60-----------------------,Here we are —Yourkeys,Written byRiccardo Dawson,"Riccardo Dawson Follow -- Listen Share So it’s the second day of 2019, we’ve launched the company, it’s the only thing that I’ve thought about for the last few years and it finally happened, in September last year we went live with our soft launch after nearly 12 months of 5 am starts and long nights. The day we ended for Christmas, we saw the first transaction through the platform — an awesome feeling and a great achievement. So, why are we doing what we’re doing? Why — we believe that buying your new home should be easy, transparent and fun. That is why I started making my way down this path in the first place. So, let’s start from the beginning. As a result of my training as an architect, I’ve always had an eye for design and detail, I’m the kind of guy that walks down the street and notices that the detailing on a building is asymmetrical and then proceeds to tell all his friends about it (yep, I’m a riot at parties!). So when I joined Shape Real Estate as Sales and Marketing Director at 24, in hindsight, a role I was massively under-qualified for, my naive, wide-eyed self wanted to make an impression, and an impression I made. Having come from a world of design, I believed that through good story-telling you could sell anything, even £1m+ apartments. I convinced the board that if we doubled the marketing budget, I could create a narrative around the building which would lead them to sell more quickly and therefore recoup the overspend. I did things very differently to normal marketing campaigns — I created the first ‘pop-up’ marketing suite in Piccadilly Circus station, put on a street party and created various guerilla campaigns. We improved sales, but not enough to justify the overspend. The market stagnated and buyers couldn’t have cared less about the story they just wanted to buy a place and get through the process unscathed — I was definitely not the employee of the month. So, why am I telling you this? I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurs look for broken things that matter to people. Holes in the fabric of life that could be patched with ingenuity and a bit of effort to make life easier for everyone. So after the confidence knock I took from the marketing budget escapade, I was back on my feet and back looking for broken things to fix. One thing I did notice when dealing with all of these property transactions was the fear and confusion in the eyes of the buyers, as they approached such a milestone in their lives. A young couple hand-in-hand walking towards the marketing suite with a smile from ear to ear, only for the happiness to drain from their faces when they are told: “now, you need a conveyancer, an AIP, searches need to be done, enquiries made, exchange contracts and don’t forget insurance, oh, and you have 28 days to get it done, bye!” I realised there that must be a better way. I spent the next 12 months learning everything I could about the process end-to-end and talking to everyone throughout the supply chain; conveyancers, brokers, agents, surveyors — all to find out what their issues were and to understand the process from their side of the fence. After all, they’re the ones who provide the service, so if they are doing their jobs correctly the buyers should all be happy, right?

https://medium.com/@diane.huang_2500/the-automation-of-creativity-c91c2fe4d1f1?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,The Automation of Creativity,Written byDiane,"Diane Follow -- 1 Listen Share This is the full version of my piece published onQueen’s Business Review. Artificial Intelligence. The term has become ubiquitous in this digital age. Highly complex, opaque yet celebrated. We are grateful for the ease it brings through recommendation engines on retail, music and streaming platforms. Nevertheless, overwhelming choices have led us to trade in our purchasing behaviour and transaction data for an algorithm that simply reinforces our own tastes of the past. What is “taste?” How is it possible thatthe world’s most valuable companybuilt an empire reimagining appearance of an ancient consumer-electronics industry, receive as many praises as criticism for their “timeless design?” Through a philosophical lens, natural taste is “not a theoretical knowledge; it is a quick and exquisite application of rules which we do not even know.” The unknowingness of whether something is tasteful to us cannot be measured or captured by a singular algorithm. Companies such as Facebook and Amazon dominate our digital identities — sorting us intobehaviour-based clusters. Even with top Ph.D. hires, algorithms in these companies are heavily reliant on tracking our past behaviours, limiting our field of vision to extensions of the rearview mirror as opposed to organically new and creative content we may find tasteful down the road. Before Netflix dictated our next show and Amazon suggested our next purchase, we had to discover and make these choices for ourselves. The friction between decisions led to the consideration of various options, and through this, we aggregated our unique personal taste. It is time to recognize the implications behind how advanced technologies of the modern day, such as artificial intelligence, may do more to set us back than propel us forward. Behind the noisy celebrations of buzzwords, algorithms are quietly curating and promoting generic content that can drastically alter our personal tastes. Perhaps one of the greatest examples is a platform that boasts83 million active usersin a bid to define and rework artistic taste. In 2017,Spotify listeners spent half their time on the app exclusively listening to playlists. The service serves up a weekly “Discover” playlist that’s reportedly fine-tuned to each listener’s preference based on their Spotify “taste profile.” The playlist is curated strictly by machine and aims to find songs for the user that feed their particular music appetite. However,in a post by avid Spotify user Adam Pasick inQuartz, he outlines his shock when he heard the exact same tracks being played in a coffee shop as his Discover playlist. Homero, a barista and band member, was “given a nearly identical mixtape” as Adam that week. The reality that even having two billion playlists filtered through a supposedly advanced algorithm can still churn out identical results for two different listeners, proves the threat of AI promoting generic taste and content for all. In 2015, EDM artist Tiesto released “Burn” on Spotify, apiece commissioned directly by the music streaming servicecatered for their workout playlists. Burn was created specifically to adapt to the running pace tempo of any listener. Unfortunately, the intent of artistic creation in the music industry has drastically progressed in this direction. The practice of making music designed to game algorithms and be successfully picked up by a Spotify playlist has inevitably created an era of “easy music.” George Ergatoudis, the former head of content at Spotify, admits that the industry is moving towards creation centred around understanding streaming algorithms: “There are pitches for specific playlists more often now. This didn’t happen even a year ago.” When artists notice that virality and popularity are being prioritized for vanilla musicians, they start to credit their idiosyncratic and unique musical styles as inferior. The intent of creating future music for the sake of pure artistic expression and vision is dwindling as a victim of demand for AI-driven homogeneity. Furthermore, the potential of challenging, innovative and groundbreaking music has beenput at stake. Algorithms like Spotify’s favour spikes in listenership and viral content.Studies have shownthat consistently working safe and “easy music” into all playlists are fundamentally changing listeners’ collective preference and taste for what they consider a “good song” in the future. The Spotify-induced phenomenon of “lean back listening” has consequently spawned a new genre of music creation. Algorithmically optimized playlists entitled: “Ambient Chill,” “Chill Covers,” and the particularly popular “Chill Tracks” with over 2.4 million followers place easygoing and anesthetized tracks at the fingertips of listeners. A label owner commented bluntly, “the more vanilla the release, the better it works for Spotify. If it’s challenging music? Nah.” He continued by stating that much of their comparatively experimental and aggressive music goes unheard on the platform due to unfavourable exposure by Spotify algorithm.“It leaves artists behind. If Spotify is just feeding easy music to everybody, where does the art form go? Is anybody going to be able to push boundaries and break through to a wide audience anymore?” Cultivating an ephemeral culture filled with mainstream pop music can only shape our taste towards uniform linearity and consequently damage authentic creativity in the long run. As Marian Mazzone, an art professor at the College of Charleston eloquently puts it, “Eventually, we may opt to shift our definition of art in order to make accommodation for the [so-called] creativity of artificial intelligence.” What used to be a boundless form of art to release frustration, passion, hunger, anger and personal identity has shrunk to feeding the automation of Musak. The trend parallels across other industries.The Echo Look— Amazon’s take on a computerized fashion advisor — purports to recommend the ideal fashion, style, and taste for each user albeit standing as a lifeless black-box camera on shelves. An interview with the director of a recent Netflix hit: All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, Susan Johnson, reveals that the movie was requested solely based on Netflix’s digital analysis.“[Netflix has] teams everywhere literally looking for what people are searching for. So they realized that people were looking for romantic comedies.” Evidently, investing in a film-version of the novel was not a consequence of Netflix investing in creativity, but in fuelling their commercial algorithm. Johnson even called the process“a little Big Brother,”with Netflix controlling what and how we consume. Moreover, Netflix stated that their recommendation algorithm “influences choice for about 80% of hours streamed” on the service. Thus, Netflix’s own content will undoubtedly benefit, being forcefully advertised regardless of each viewer’s true taste preference. In the end, not only was All The Boys I’ve Loved Before a mega-success, but it helped the service influenceover 80 million subscribers to watch content in the rom-com genrefor the remainder of Summer. Talk about generalizing taste. In actuality, the increasing role of artificial intelligence does not make our fashion sense or music tastes more distinct — but instead silos us into a homogenizing box, calculating where we land in the “average” identity. The fact that these average identities come in minute shades (a song or two different on the Discover playlist), only means that they are far from unique. Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly shaping individual choices and the wider social fabric at every moment. Taken individually, it appears that sacrificing privacy and data is worthwhile for the ease of convenience and efficiency. Presently, at scale, our preferences are being driven by the hands of the massive technology companies whom we’ve handed the wheel. In this case, the salient tradeoff in this glossy AI age is not privacy, but our personal taste and identity. The manipulation of an entire industry led by Spotify’s algorithms has become the operating motive and expected standard for music lovers and artists. Conforming to the algorithm game stifles innovation borne of colliding tastes and ideas. Needless to say, colouring outside of the lines is nearly impossible when constrained in a future of singular taste and bland inspiration. The subtle yet damaging outcome ofdisplacing the judgment of taste to algorithms will inevitably rob us of our humanity. In all, we should tread gently on our reliance on leading-edge technology, remaining wary of its threatening ability to suppress true novelty and cultivate a homogenous view on creativity.",Diane,https://medium.com/@dianehuang?source=post_page---byline--c91c2fe4d1f1---------------------------------------,280,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg,2019-01-02T04:08:01.695Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@monicachin_40788/reviews-of-all-the-tech-i-bought-in-2018-c9f061bd668b?source=tag_archive---------60-----------------------,Reviews Of All The Tech I Bought In 2018,Written bymwc,"mwc Follow -- Listen Share I hate the end of the year. This is the time when everyone else comes out with photo albums and essays detailing just how wonderful and transformative their 2018 was. I’m the same self I was 365 days ago. I spent some of those days meeting people, exploring, growing, changing, and broadening my horizons. But I spent most of them playing with tech. I’m no good at writing reflective thinkpieces, but I do know how to criticize consumer technology. So I’ve dug through my Amazon account and various bank statements to pull together a list of all the gadgets I bought this year. Here’s what I thought of it all. Surface Book 2 Story time. In August I sent my boyfriend the following request: “Please find me the cheapest place to buy the Surface Book 2.” It was finally time to break up with the Macbook Pro. I love macOS, but that keyboard is a flaming pile of flat, ugly, clickety-clackety nonsense. I’m sure Tim Cook is sobbing for the loss of my patronage. He found it, from a seller called Julitech Deals, almost $500 below MSRP. What could go wrong? I ordered it, with a core i7 and a 1050 TI. These are words that Mac-Monica would have heard as gibberish. It came in a fancy box, I unboxed it for Instagram, and I loved it the minute I opened it. I began to play real-time strategy games in bed, an activity of which Mac-Monica had dreamed, endlessly, for years on end. I even used it as a tablet once or twice. You know, just to do it. Then, about a week into my dream world, my boyfriend burst the bubble. “That thing isn’t running on a GPU,” he told me, peaking over my shoulder at my game of Civilization V. He dug into my system and, sure enough, there was no GPU to be found. I’d been scammed into purchasing the model with an i5 and integrated graphics. Julitech Deals, illustrious and established as they are, did not respond to my flurry of angry emails. Luckily, Amazon had stamped its “Fulfilled By” sticker on the brand, so we could make it their problem. Within a week, I’d returned the inferior unit, and called back the one I was supposed to have, from Amazon directly, at a much higher price. I love it. I guess the moral of the story is: Get you a man who can distinguish between Intel integrated graphics and a 1050TI on sight. Lay-N-Go Wired Tech Bag I moved to New York City to like, follow my writing dream or whatever. My cohabitants are rich, fast, and busy. They all seem to have plans, and large social networks. I’m sure they’re not actually thriving in that fast-paced mess, but god damn are they good at pretending. “I’m busy until 6, can we do 7?” “I was out with friends yesterday, and I heard…” I don’t feel like I belong there. As much as I’d like to be one of those people, I’m not. Rural Connecticut looks more alien every time I come home. The children seem younger. I recognize an old teacher (barely) and don’t say hi. According to Instagram, my high school group of friends is getting together without me. It’s fine. I didn’t keep in touch. I don’t know how to explain my job or college major to the people who live in this town, and with new piercings, a new hair color, and many pounds lost, I’m not sure they’d recognize me anyway. There’s nothing left for me here. When I’m sitting on my couch feeling bummed about it all, I pull out this bag. My Lay-N-Go contains multitudes: my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, an iPad, a charger, a smart watch, a couple apps, an e-book or two, and the afternoon is my own. Not New York’s, and not Lakeville’s — mine. It’s a piece of the city I’ve brought with me to this tiny village in the hills. A taste of things that are expensive, busy, and made for one person alone. “Just flip the bird,” a friend once told me. Flip the bird at them all. Hormonal IUD I will never forget my male gynecologist’s face as he inserted this thing into my body. “Ah, the things women have to go through,” he mused, chuckling to himself, as I squirmed, biting my tongue to keep from screaming, watching myself bleed. If you’re inclined to make quips like this, perhaps consider a career other than a gynecologist. The following is not an exaggeration: Every time I mention to someone that i have an IUD, they tell me they know someone who knows someone who almost died or is now infertile because of a complication with their own IUD. Honestly, just stop. Stop telling me about these people. I don’t need you all spooking me about what science conclusively says is probably a safe procedure if you do all the proper things. Just go. Shoo. Anyway, no babies yet. Amazon Echo Show I did areal reviewof this thing, so I won’t get too into the weeds here. I fell in love a couple times this year. My first love brought a woman home when I was out of town, fed her my drugs, and kissed her on our couch. I was in Seattle when I found out, and I cried for ten minutes in a bathroom stall. Sometimes I scroll back through our messages, just to make myself feel something. I don’t want to forget what he did. My second love was the Echo Show. It has never once cheated on me, and also comes with Hulu, NBC, and two browsers built in. As it has no legs, I never have to worry about it packing it in and walking out while I’m out of town on weekends. It’s never going to convince me that something I was a victim of was my fault. And, best of all, it’s never going to lie. Right, Alexa? Don’t lie. Now play Mrs. Maisel. Please. TP-Link ADSL2 Modem I don’t care how much Spectrum throttles me (and I know it is) — my modem is my modem, and there’s nothing you all can do about it. After moving into my current apartment, I cried almost all night. Everything around me felt alien, and I was viscerally aware that I’d left a life behind. I would have watched Netflix to distract myself, but the modem that Spectrum had given me wasn’t working. The next morning, I bought one of three modems that I found in the back corner of Best Buy’s basement, covered in plastic and dust. I watched Netflix the rest of that day, and I haven’t cried since. Rubik’s Cube At one point this year, I was working a job where my boss thought I was bad. It happens. But it was my first job out of college (save a summer internship) and it hurt. Multiple times, I left crying. I began the job thinking I wanted to be a journalist, and ended it thinking I wasn’t worthy of flipping burgers. I’m the only person I know who can solve a Rubik’s cube. It was hard at first, but I figured out the algorithms, the way the pieces work together. I hate myself for it, but I smile when I watch others struggle. I finally bought myself one of these as a reminder — you are a thinker. “Do not let one idiot stop you from achieving greatness,” a friend texted me after I left a meeting crying. My boss had, in sugarcoated terms, told me I wasn’t very smart. At the time, and throughout the job, I reminded myself that I could be great, that I shouldn’t listen to the haters — all the things they say on motivational posters. But after a year of reflection, what I saw as an injustice I see now as a necessary douse of cold water. My boss wasn’t the main obstacle I needed to overcome: My ego was. I wasn’t good enough. I won’t be until I’ve proven myself — and I didn’t do that this year. So I’ve put the Rubik’s Cube away. I need to work on other things. Raymor and Flanigan Lamp Chrome Floor Lamp There is a man who does not love me, who I am not sure I will ever stop loving. I have loved him for years. I bought this lamp because its title sounded similar to his name. That’s all I’m going to say, because it’s very possible he’s reading this, and I don’t want to ruin our friendship which is, outside of the feelings-y weirdness, very nice. Then again, isn’t that all friendships? Dude, I’m glad I met you, but I’m sad that I still love you. Please get bad plastic surgery, or go work at Burger King or something, so that I can return this lamp. At the moment, it’s still in the corner of my living room, so I’m still thinking about you. Audible Subscription Everyone says you need to read to be a good writer. I don’t doubt this. But I never liked reading, for whatever reason. The internet pulled me away from it in early high school, and I never went back. I’ve tried to read a number of different books, but nothing sticks. It’s just not fun for me. I bought this Audible subscription at the beginning of 2018, hoping it would help me learn to love books. But so far, I’ve found audiobooks even easier to put down than books are. My brain just tunes them out when it’s bored. When I tune back in, I’ve lost the plot of the story, so I’m bored again, and the cycle repeats. I don’t doubt that my writing suffers because I rarely read. Please let me know if you have suggestions, because Audible didn’t help. Prose Shampoo I get why you’re all upset with Facebook’s collecting and selling of our data. I’ll admit that it makes me uneasy at times. But here’s a silver lining: In early September, I complained to a friend (via Facebook Messenger) that I couldn’t, for the life of me, find an affordable shampoo that I liked. A few hours later, an ad for Frose appeared on my timeline. I punched in my info and ordered it. It’s perfect. My hair feels like satin after I’ve used it. Where has this shampoo been all my life? Thank you, Mark and Sheryl. Off-World Trading Company I bought this game to play with a man I’ve been in love with for too long. The game is everything I see him as: beautiful, tongue-in-cheek, fiercely analytical. The narrator’s voice reminds me a bit of his. But I suppose the closest thing I have to a new-year’s resolution is to stop being hung up on those who don’t love me back: lovers, friends, family, and all. I guess the first step to that is getting rid of this game.",mwc,https://medium.com/@monicachin_40788?source=post_page---byline--c9f061bd668b---------------------------------------,1,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NOYvJKDRVloeb1f3PEEwSw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NOYvJKDRVloeb1f3PEEwSw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NOYvJKDRVloeb1f3PEEwSw.jpeg,2019-01-01T04:48:11.743Z,Medium

Its manager, Kwon Jang-hee, is passionate about protecting children from the ill effects of the internet, and above all of smartphones, which he considers most damaging of all because of their omnipresence. Parents do not understand how dangerous the internet is, he says, pointing to a study by Seoul National University that detected similarities between the brain activity of cocaine addicts and computer-games enthusiasts. If he had his way, youngsters would have to wait for their smartphones until they had graduated from high school. In one of the world’s most highly connected societies there is little chance that he will get his wish, but plenty of South Korean parents agree that their children are overdosing on screens. A recent government survey on smartphone and internet addiction put the share of three- to nine-year-olds at high risk of addiction at 1.2% and that of teenagers at 3.5%. That may not seem a lot, but when it happens the effects can be devastating.

When we look at crypto price, it’s very depressing to see the fluctuating price variation which is partially influenced by people’s exaggerated imagination about blockchain’s value. However, WaykiChain won’t shy away from the challenge, but strive to enhance our chain’s value, manifest the ecosystem we are going to create, and carry out our mission with unceasing effort of courage. In the turbulent 2018, WaykiChain adhered to our core value and vision. We have achieved: WaykiChain(WICC) was listed in over 100 exchanges WaykiChain mainnet was officially launched; WaykiChain developed two DApps based on our public chain: WaykiBet and WaykiTimes. During 2018 FIFA World Cup, WaykiChain launched a series of community events, caused a downloading frenzy of WaykiChain Wallet and created a bang in China. WaykiChain kicked off overseas marketing and initiated WaykiChain’s globalized development. WaykiChain and FoundGame reached strategic cooperation to co-develop game application ecosystem. WaykiChain and China Commerce Department reached strategic cooperation In 2019, WaykiChain will head for the following three goals: To realize WaykiChain’s business model and offer commercialized products tonon-crypto businesses.We are determined to jump out of the comfort zone of blockchain world and create truly useful value for a wider masses. It requires the whole team’s joint efforts, including further technology refinements from tech dept, constant innovation from product dept, brand building from marketing dept and partnerships introduction from biz dept. To make a breakthrough in overseas development and re-construct local consensus.In 2019, WaykiChain will spare no effort to break through the gaps in many fields, including investors community, technology ecosystem, global first-tier exchanges listing, international partners and Dapp ecosystem, etc. As for local consensus, we’ll define WaykiChain with a new concept and spirit and consolidate local market’s perception of WaykiChain after our reflection, transformation and upgrading. To expand our staff team and strengthen our corporate culture.In the new year, WaykiChain will invest more time, resources and energy to employee development and corporate value construction. We wish more and more talents to join WaykiChain and work together with us to pass down our values and realize our vision. In closing Actually, blockchain has impacted many fields globally and many governments are devoting close attention to its development. We firmly believe that it’s only a matter of time before blockchain changes the way we live and work and pervades every aspect of our daily life through technical renovation and business model innovation. I think everyone’s efforts will contribute to blockchain industry’s further development in the next ten years and blockchain will open a new chapter in the history of mankind. To conclude, I would like to emphasize our vision here: WaykiChain is committed to building a decentralized and community self-governance big platform and big ecosystem.

Let’s bust some common myths about this technology and its applications!,"A recentsurveyfromHSBCsuggests that Blockchain is among the least understood new technologies. Let’s bust some common myths about this technology and its applications! Systango Follow -- Listen Share Despite being the most hard-hitting buzzword of the present era, a grand number of people are still clueless about the potential and practical applications of Blockchain. Also, equal, if not more, are the people who claim they ‘understand’ all dynamics & intricacies of this new-age tech, but they don’t. And as they say, half knowledge is worse than ignorance. Blockchain, in its crude form, is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) whose append-only nature provides a robust mechanism to store data in data blocks. These blocks are linked cryptographically via hash functions, making it virtually impossible to change data of a particular block without disturbing the rest of the block sequence that followed. Simply put, it’s like a growing set of public record that carries a possibility to disrupt multiple industries and streamline their business operations. Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies are the most popular use cases of Blockchain. Now, among the good and the bad they say about Blockchain, there are certain misleading ‘facts’ as well which are propagated without second thoughts. Today, we’ll debunk some common myths and misconceptions whirling around Blockchain- Myth 01- Blockchain Can Be Used to Transform Anything & Everything Blockchain is like the new big data or AI — too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists! Blockchain is like the new big data or AI — too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists! These words from Ripple’s CEOBrad Garlinghousesums up all that we have to say. We agree the code is powerful, but it’s not a solution to all sorts of problems. You need to weigh if your business has scope to introduce a Blockchain innovation or align one with your legacy systems to exploit the power of decentralisation. Ask yourself, will Blockchain enhance consumer consumption? Will it help in cost savings? Will I see a surge in productivity? How many practical use cases are there for my industry? Analyse all aspects effectively and see if Blockchain implementation is worthwhile. Before making any mind,connect with Blockchain expertsfor a consultation to better recognise the disrupting capabilities of Blockchain for your business. Myth_02- Blockchain is Only a Storage Mechanism Things people say! By design and definition, Blockchain is a distributed database, making a large number of people think (and believe) that Blockchain is a sophisticated storage mechanism. Let’s burst the bubble- it’s one of the perks that arrives when it’s used as an exchange application. Blockchain wasn’t devised to store your comprehensive data but to store information as a transaction, with which you can see every piece of data generating a hash. The hash can be used to verify the authenticity of that data, thus skyrocketing trust and transparency. Myth_03- Tokens and Coins are the Same Thing Well, they are not. Blockchain has Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and tokens, and they are not synonymous. Coins bring along a single utility- they act as digital money and can be used to buy or sell things. They can be received, sent, or mined and are not meant to perform any function other than serving as a medium of exchange. Tokens, on the other hand, are digital assets that can have one or more functions inside a project ecosystem. They can act as coins and also represent an asset or utility. Myth_04- Blockchain is Bitcoin We get it- Blockchain gained the recognition it deserves after the unprecedented popularity of Bitcoin. But is Blockchain all about Bitcoin? Absolutely not! One who has familiarity with the potential of Blockchain can tell you in a heartbeat that Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. The real-world applications and use cases of Blockchain are making waves in the digital world and positively impacting multitudinous industries; Finance, Healthcare, and Logistics to name a few. Bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate secure online transactions. To understand Blockchain beyond Bitcoin, check our blog-5 Practical Non-Bitcoin Applications of Blockchain Myth_05- Blockchain Can be Scaled Infinitely Yet another misconception about Blockchain relates with its ability to scale. Blockchain is widely positioned as “growing list of records”, giving an impression that Blockchain can be scaled to an infinite extent. Well, this isn’t the case. Blockchain can’t be scaled, at least now. The decentralised consensus mechanism of Blockchain comes with gold-like benefits- fault tolerance, sky-high security, and political neutrality, but associates the big-time pain of scalability. The number of transactions the blockchain can process cannot exceed that of a single node which is participating in the network. It is also to be noted that with the addition of every new node, the phenomenon of inter-node latency comes into play that makes Blockchain weaker. Hope this clears why Blockchain can’t be scaled endlessly. So, this was our effort to dispel the myths about Blockchain and add more clarity to your knowledge base.

https://medium.com/@coinberry/bitcoin-birthday-8934230aa859?source=tag_archive---------133-----------------------,Happy Birthday to Bitcoin!,Written byCoinberry,"Coinberry Follow -- Listen Share There are two dates often considered for the birth of Bitcoin: October 31, 2009— The Bitcoin Whitepaper is released. January 3, 2010— The first transaction takes place on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Genesis Block is created. There is some contention in the crypto community as to the true birth date of Bitcoin. We’re proudly in the camp of the first transaction, the first material activity of digital currency and blockchain technology! It’s amazing how much can happen in a decade. The genesis of Bitcoin launched a tidal wave of activity in the crypto space which isnow proudly home to over 2000 digital currencies. As of this writing, Bitcoin has a $67 billion market cap, with millions of transactions — all this activity is indeed a tidal wave of users surfing its wake throughout the internet. Where will the next decade take us?Time will tell. But if the previous decade is an example, we can only count on massive change, with repercussions rippling out into a radically technological future. We are incredibly excited about what will come next, and we do owe our existence to the birth of Bitcoin. Without it, who knows what we would be doing! We’d still be paying for things with fiat … who does that anymore!? As crypto and blockchain continue to garner attention from bigger institutions and the general public we expect the space to thrive on this, to continue to grow, to innovate, to adapt, and to amaze. We’re all in. Will you join us?

Keri Savoca Follow The Startup -- 3 Listen Share I wrote an article in mid-December that went “viral” and amassed over 20,000 views in the first day. Of course, I was disappointed when my other articles didn’t get much attention, but when I took a look at my erratic earnings, I realized that I had stumbled upon a golden opportunity to closely examine Medium’s stats — beyond fans and claps. Buckle up; I was serious when I said that this is going to be an in-depth analysis. I will examine the following: number of fans number of claps whether the article was distributed by Medium’s editors whether the article was published independently or in a publication how non-member articles compared I will attempt to determine: whether fans or claps are a better indicator of earnings whether it is possible to earn money from non-distributed articles whether articles in publications earn more than articles published independently 1. Viral, distributed, in a publication What Happened When I Cancelled My Home Internet And Why I Never Resubscribed theascent.pub I earned $241.96 for this article, which was published on December 18. The article received 22,000 views and ~1,000 claps in the first 24 hours, which was reflected in Week 4 below. The remaining views and claps are reflected in Week 5. This is the only one of my articles that keeps getting nearly 1,000 views per day, so for this one, I will do my calculations based on the stats I had on Sunday, when the pay period ended. They were roughly: 33,000 views 14,000 reads 1,900 claps 286 fans Possible outlier:21,000 views came from Flipboard, sometime between 1 and 4 hours after publishing, while I slept. This article was added to The Ascent a day afterwards. However, those 21,000 views on day 1 only resulted in ~200 claps, most of which were from non members. The remaining 15,000 views (and claps from Medium members) came from within Medium, immediately after distribution and publication in The Ascent. 2. Non-viral, distributed, in a publication Why I Wish I Hadn’t Gone to College or grad school, or grad school again theascent.pub 700 views 325 reads 295 claps 21 fans 3. Non-viral, distributed, not in a publication Uber’s New Minimum Wage and why it hasn’t yet gone into effect medium.com 146 views 92 reads 28 claps 3 fans This article received claps from 3 people — all Medium members. One left 26 claps, and the other 2 left 1 clap each. 4. Non-viral, not distributed, in a publication Remembering Y2K a collection of news coverage from December 1999 medium.com 56 views 15 reads 38 claps 1 fan 5. Non-viral, not distributed, not in a publication 10 New Year’s Resolutions That Anyone Can Keep 1. Be kind to others. medium.com 29 views 12 reads 46 claps 3 fans 6. Non-viral, not distributed, in a publication, free article Note: see below for an update about free articles that are not in publications. Making Medium Visual — All The Things You Can Embed in Your Stories Let’s move beyond plain text and stock images. writingcooperative.com This one was published on December 24 and is listed as still awaiting review by Medium’s editors, probably because I had made it a members-only article inadvertently, and the publication had to change this. 230 views 114 reads 246 claps 24 fans Value of claps and fans: Effects of distribution and publications: Worthy of note is that Medium might not ever review your story for distribution; theircuration guidelinesstate that not all articles will be reviewed. Keep this in mind. Stats for members only vs. free articles: As this is a free article, I can issue a call to action. Feel free to clap (in the name of science) to help me gather data for a future update. Medium Staff: Any reason that free articles are ineligible for distribution in topics?

https://medium.com/@experimatt/how-i-approach-the-job-search-1902ad95a3?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,How I approach the job search,Published inInvisible Network Blog,"Matt Decuir Follow Invisible Network Blog -- 3 Listen Share Throughout my career, I’ve seen first hand how terrible the experience of looking for a new job can be. Having just gone through the process again recently, I can assure you that it’sstillterrible. After graduating from college, it took me 6 months to find my first full-time job. What I didn’t know at the time was thatapplying without already knowing someone at the company is a recipe for failure. Mind you, this was 10+ years ago, but the takeaway still holds. Next, a recruiter found me and connected me with a great new job, but working with that recruiter was such a terrible experience that I vowed to never work with one again. Eventually, I figured out that it doesn’t matter how smart you are or how great your resume looks.People get jobs through other people. It feels odd for me to say this, but I’ve finally figured out a job search process that consistently works, and wanted to share it with you, in case it’s helpful: Step 1:Write up your dream job description. If you could define exactly what you’d be doing on a daily basis, and where you’d be doing it, what would that look like? Step 2:Update your resume.Resumes are stupid and terrible, but they’re unfortunately still a necessary part of the process. Step 3: Make a list of companies, not jobs, that may be a good fit for you.Go looking for companies who align with the most important parts of your dream job description (location, size, industry, values, tech stack, etc…). Step 4: Meet with people at each of those companies.If you already know someone who works there, great! If not, find someone who can introduce you to someone there. Ask them to grab coffee or lunch with you (always pay). Ask them what it’s like to work there, and inquire about any openings that might be a good fit for you. If there’s a possible fit, ask to be connected with the right person to get the ball rolling. Step 5: Follow up.Always, always, follow up. The people you’re meeting with are busy, and it’s likely not personal if they’re slow to respond. By taking the initiative and sending gentle thank you/reminder emails, you’ll stand out. This is important to remember even if you’re not interested in the company. Thank people because they took time out of their busy days to meet you. Step 6: Fill out applications.Only after being asked to, as a formality. This is where your resume comes in. As for cover letters, keep them short and sweet. Step 7: Interview.Ask a lot of questions and be your charming self. They’ll like you. Repeat steps 4 to 7until you’re able to definitively say yes or no to a company. Remember, you’re evaluating the company just as much as they are evaluating you. Trust your gut — if something doesn’t feel right to you, pay attention to that. Step 8: You get an offer. Step 9: Negotiate. Always negotiate. Step 10: You accept an offer. And just like that, this whirlwind process is over! You’ll notice that this whole process is oriented around yourrelationships with other people. If someone likes you and can see themselves working with you, they’ll usually do whatever they can to help you get the job.

https://medium.com/productops/the-3-phases-of-a-technology-product-implementation-phase-1-engagement-40c6b9bd74df?source=tag_archive---------115-----------------------,The 3 Phases of a Technology Product Implementation — Phase 1: Engagement,Establishing a Statement of Work (SOW),"productOps Follow productOps -- Listen Share by Steve Yatson The purpose of this blog series is to walk through our product development process from the perspective of a manager on the product/design team. As we’ve refined and developed it over the years it has become known to us internally as theproductOpsWay. The example referenced is the set-up of a Sales Order Management System forIthaka, an education technology company, but our approach is similar for all the projects we work on. Using this example, I hope to show the way various departments of our organization work with each other, and the client, to guide a successful outcome using a three phased methodology. In the first phase of any project the executive team will travel to a potential client and get travel points and five star meals. On their return, the product and design team will get notes, a debrief, and image like this: Do I sound bitter? In seriousness, this phase is an important and necessary step to understand the core needs and build a relationship with the client. The latter is usually achieved more readily after this first visit because most times neither the client nor ourselves have a firm grasp yet on what’s needed, the devilish details involved and the business or technical problem at hand. Establishing a Statement of Work (SOW) To get closer to the goal, the whiteboard sketches are cleaned up and simplified so the project managers and designers can begin to understand the scope of work and build a SOW for the discovery phase. We then move from the whiteboard to a popular diagramming and digital illustration application,OmniGraffle, for a clearer vision of the project details. Before launching into the discovery phase we want to make sure we’ve engaged with every stakeholder in the project and get as many of the requirements down up front as possible. Reflecting the project back to the client visually is a key strategy in making that happen. Once we’ve established the needs of the client, we move onto to Part 2, The Discovery Phase to be published next. Steve Yatson joinedproductOpsin 2015 as a Sr. Product Designer. He now commands a senior management position in the company, guiding his staff and productOps customers to mutual success.",productOps,https://medium.com/@productops?source=post_page---byline--40c6b9bd74df---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png,2019-01-02T19:51:01.060Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@bead/a-study-case-optimizing-hvac-in-a-fitness-chain-dc4087043b50?source=tag_archive---------134-----------------------,A STUDY CASE — OPTIMIZING HVAC IN A FITNESS CHAIN,Written byBEAD Technollogy,"BEAD Technollogy Follow -- Listen Share Our initial project which was performed with the biggest fitness chain in Turkey addressed our clients’ problems with steadily increasing and unpredictable energy cost at their 40 locations. We started with analyzing one of their location in Istanbul, which runs at 22k Euro monthly energy costs. The problem was that at that location the automation system and the building were basically disconnected from each other, which is a common pattern throughout most locations we have assessed. The automation system was installed with a proxy of maximum assumption of occupancy and no intelligence to adapt. Thus, it catered for service levels assumed to be necessary for 1000 people coming to the location during the day, vs a real life 200 to 350 occupancy at any time. BEAD identified the following patterns and allows to dynamically react to them 1- The location was only occupied after 10.00 a.m. Our dynamic adaptation to real-time occupancy saved the location close to 10% of energy cost.2- The system registered energy consumption during nighttime due to cleaning and maintenance patterns. Our dynamic adaptation to reflect actual use times saved the location further energy cost.3- The location featured windows at the roof, getting daylight for significant periods of the any given day. Adjusting another lighting to reflect the natural daylight use we changed the real-time scheduling to the lighting system, yielding a further 8% of energy cost. 1- The location was only occupied after 10.00 a.m. Our dynamic adaptation to real-time occupancy saved the location close to 10% of energy cost. 2- The system registered energy consumption during nighttime due to cleaning and maintenance patterns.

https://medium.com/@bltnapp/church-apps-are-they-helpful-or-just-a-waste-of-time-4d289286120?source=tag_archive---------117-----------------------,CHURCH APPS — are they helpful? Or just a waste of time?,Written byJustin @ bltn,"Justin @ bltn Follow -- Listen Share Does your church have an app? They’re supposed to be “the thing” to do when it comes to connecting to your congregation, but I have to wonder — do they really work? Are your members actually using your app to engage during the service? Do they check it throughout the week for updates or announcements? Maybe it’s time to sit back and evaluate the ways we spend our hours as church communicators. If we are waisting our time doing something. Let’s stop doing that thing. Sound good? The church app is one of those things that seems like a given at this point. Apps are for everywhere and for everything. If you use an app at your church, when it was first introduced, it was a source of pride that you could tell your congregation to find you in the App Store. But those days are gone. Apps have been around for a decade and now it’s an embarrassment if you don’t have one. Right? Church Apps fill the same role as any piece of technology. They are designed to serve a purpose and solve a problem. Do church apps still serve a purpose and solve a problem? Over the last 10 years, for various reasons of travel and church planting, my family has been regular attenders at 5 churches and we’ve been repeat visitors to probably 10 more. Over that time, for those 15 churches, I have downloaded 1 church app. And I’ve used that app twice.(for work I’ve seen many other church apps and e-bulletins, and such, but that’s beside the point.) Maybe you use your church app all the time. Maybe your congregation loves it. And that’s awesome. The truth of it is though that every problem that the church app is designed to solve is better solved by something else. The media player in your church app allows your congregation to listen to and watch services.78% of all video streaming online is watched via YouTube, the multi-billion dollar company. More of your congregation is watching video in YouTube than in your app. I don’t know your church or your congregation. But I’d wager anything that it is true. If last week’s sermon popped up in their subscription feed rather than in your app, how much more likely do you think it is that it will get seen? Your church app allows you to push messages to your congregation.Assuming your church app performs like any other app. For every 2 people that download the app, 1 of them will say NO to your notifications. But that’s the good news! For every 100 people to whom you send a notification, 3–6 of them will read it. Your mileage may vary of course, but the statistics on the technology of push notifications paint a very clear picture. Push notifications sent from your app do not work. Maybe you’ve trained your congregation to read them or to check in the app frequently for news, and that’s awesome. But if your announcement is where your congregation already is… facebook (~41 minutes each day), instagram (25–31 minutes each day), twitter (42% of twitter users use it every day). If you announcement is there, it is certainly more likely to be seen. You need a change of strategy. Instead of providing a place where people come to get stuff from you…. be someone who goes to where they are. The church app relies on your congregation to seek you out (and on a whole, they won’t). But a service likebltnputs your message where your congregation is. While spending less time than managing your church app, you can publish a mobile bulletin and deliver it to your congregations phones. You can set up a whole week’s worth of announcements on all your social media accounts. And you can put a paper bulletin in the hand of each member of your congregation Sunday morning. The numbers tell a story, and that story is… you should use bltn at your church. What are your thoughts? Does your church have use an app? What works well about it? What doesn’t?",Justin @ bltn,https://medium.com/@bltnapp?source=post_page---byline--4d289286120---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png,2019-01-02T22:40:40.859Z,Medium

https://medium.com/oasislabs/2019-the-year-of-privacy-c23953cc4ecb?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,2019: The Year of Privacy,Published inOasis Labs,"Dawn Song Follow Oasis Labs -- 1 Listen Share This year saw intensifying concerns around privacy. As data collection capabilities increase and companies collect unprecedented volumes of user data, the scale, frequency, and impact of data breaches have likewise amplified. These breaches, which have degraded consumer trust and led to increased government scrutiny, are the result of inadequate data protection and insufficient restrictions around data sharing and use. As the value of data rises, it will become increasingly important to strike a balance between using data and protecting privacy. Failure to do so results in data silos, which greatly diminish the value of data for innovation and societal benefit. Emerging privacy-preserving technology can help provide a win-win solution, offering unprecedented user privacy protections while enabling new applications for data. Blockchain provides transparency but not privacy: on current blockchain platforms, transactions and data are publicly visible. Privacy-preserving techniques combined with blockchain can enable new decentralized applications that protect data while providing users with transparency and control over how data is used. Theseprivacy-first applicationswill help restore consumer trust, creating a virtuous cycle that fosters development of data-driven applications. We think 2019 will see a dramatic shift to privacy-first applications, catalyzed by three growing trends that reinforce each other: an increased user demand to control their own privacy, the rollout of new privacy regulations, and advancements in privacy-preserving technologies. Data breaches and privacy violations escalated in 2018. Large technology companies including Facebook and Google came under fire for failing to protect user data, and nearly every industry — from banking to retail — suffered major data breaches. The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated that business models dependent on collection and monetization of user data are a fine balancing act, often putting the interests of the business in conflict with the users they serve. The incident served as a reminder that for many internet services, there’s a tradeoff between using the service and giving up one’s privacy. These issues have resulted in a heightened distrust by the general public of organizations that collect and monetize user data. It has increased awareness of the insufficiency of current protections for data, leading many to forego the use of products and services out of concern that their data will be sold or misused. We saw signs of this trend in 2018. Campaigns such as #DeleteFacebook spread across the internet with viral speed as users began protesting companies that misuse their data; and Apple CEO Tim Cook called privacy a “fundamental human right”, raising concerns about the crisis of the “data-industrial complex”. Many signs point to a tipping point in 2019 where customers en masse willdemandprivacy protection and the ability to control how their data is used, and will opt-out of services that don’t provide this. 2018 saw the official rollout of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to enhance consumer privacy protection. This trend is expanding into other countries and individual states in the US. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect in 2020, is among the most stringent state-level protections, requiring companies who collect user information to use it responsibly and to provide transparency to consumers on data use. Federal government oversight in the US is already tightening and will likely result in additional regulations. In 2018 Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg were both called by Congress to answer questions about their companies’ data practices. The increasing government scrutiny and risk of huge fines will motivate other companies to be proactive about privacy protection. This shift in regulatory policies will force companies who have insufficient privacy protections to take actions. Adopting strong privacy protections will be an existential requirement rather than a luxury. For the vast majority of technology companies, whose revenue and growth depend on utilizing user data, timely deployment of new privacy-preserving solutions is essential. The good news is that 2018 saw significant progress in the research and development of privacy-enhancing technologies. Cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption saw increased research and development activity from the blockchain community, who view privacy as essential for enabling and driving many new blockchain applications. While these cryptographic techniques are important, they are not yet practical for general applications. Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption can be very slow, ranging from thousands to more than millions of times slower than native execution. We think hardware-based approaches are therefore critical, and 2019 will see the rise of hardware-based approaches for secure computing, including hardware-based acceleration of cryptographic techniques as well as trusted hardware. Specialized hardware such as ASICs can give a performance boost to cryptographic techniques, bringing simple applications within reach. Another technology known astrusted hardwarewill further expand the application domains of secure computing. Trusted hardware provides a secure execution environment called asecure enclavethat allows execution of code at near-native speeds while isolating data and code from other software running on the machine, including the operating system. Trusted hardware will enable a broad range of new applications on blockchain by allowing complex workloads to execute at scale while protecting privacy. The world’s largest chipset manufacturers already offer secure enclave chipsets in products ranging from servers to laptops. In 2018 several major cloud providers began offering access to secure enclaves in the cloud, further increasing availability of this technology. Additionally, the release of theKeystonesecure enclave in 2018 marks the first general-purpose secure enclave framework available as open-source. This milestone will lower the barriers for developing chipsets with secure enclaves, enable faster adoption, and accelerate research in secure hardware technology. Differential privacyis another promising technology that provides strong, formal privacy guarantees. Last year saw increased research activity in practical techniques for differential privacy. These technologies are especially potent when combined with blockchain. The data breaches in 2018 have made consumers increasingly suspicious of opaque centralized solutions. The technologies described above can add privacy to blockchain, providing an ideal combination of transparency and privacy — without relying on a central party. 2019 will be the year of privacy. The confluence of these three forces — increasing user awareness and concern, regulatory policy changes, and improved capabilities of privacy technologies — will bring privacy to the fore and usher in a new paradigm of privacy-first applications.

https://medium.com/predict/big-ideas-for-2019-and-beyond-2892543274ad?source=tag_archive---------64-----------------------,Big Ideas for 2019 and beyond,What are you looking forward to in 2019?,"What are you looking forward to in 2019? Andre Podnozov Follow Predict -- Listen Share LinkedIn approached me about expressing my views on what will be the Big Ideas of 2019, in a similar vein to theirprediction piece. So I came up with my own list, except these are not predictions per se — after all, I’m no shaman and I can’t see the future. Instead, the ideas on this list — they are simply in the air and I’m only channeling them. Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019, whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades. 1. Re-shoring and vertical integration With de-globalization picking up steam, deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand, it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples, Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities, which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole, to strengthened geopolitical position of the country. 2. Advanced technologies struggling in the market In another consequence of fragmenting global markets, the pace of innovation is slowing down, especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists, their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success, especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power, tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean, how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room, including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done, however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals. 3. Rising prestige of science As the ancient wisdom says, nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token, it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape, we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately, core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays, compared to Business degrees for example. In fact, hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings, according tosome studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum, we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science, for example, becomes more desirable than an MBA! 4. Big initiatives that inspire and unite It is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature, for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress, for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally, technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age, but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress, which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials. 5. Social technologies for the people There is a lot of opportunity in using technology to further social goals. For example, the society would benefit from increased sense of trust between all participants. Alas, all the cat and dog videos crowding the social network feeds don’t go quite far enough towards building that sense of community. I look forward to new generation of social technologies that are aimed at bringing out the best in people, rather than monetizing the hours they spend in front of the screen. 6. Focus on Basic Needs and overwhelming end-user value I wrote a separate article on this, so I’ll just link to it rather than be repetitive:Basic Needs as a driver of the Next Industrial Revolution 7. Hype heading for the exit Ok, over-hyped technologies, you know who you are… yes I’m looking at you Blockchain. Well, if I were to be serious for a moment, commonly circulated decentralized money would have far-reaching consequences for our civilization because it would challenge the millennia-old status quo. And that’s exactly why this would never be allowed to happen — not until a major climate disruption in hell, I would think. In the meantime, the exaggerated amount of attention devoted to over-hyped technologies is distracting and counter-productive. It would be best to focus our collective energies on higher-priority goals. 8. Big guys getting bigger Big players tend to weather the trying times better than smaller companies. In the end of the day this allows the big guys to get even bigger — that’s the “last-man-standing” reward of sorts. Let’s take a specific example — cloud providers. At this point I think it’s safe to say that we will not have more than 3 cloud providers in the US anymore. We may even see this number starting to get reduced to 2. In closing Challenges and opportunities always go hand-in-hand, so let us enter 2019 with optimism and the best New Year wishes all-around!

https://home.ohumanity.org/responding-to-superintelligence-6b9cbeddbd54?source=tag_archive---------64-----------------------,Responding to Superintelligence,Surviving Superintelligence: Part 2 of 4,"Surviving Superintelligence: Part 2 of 4 LeeAnn Felder-Heim Follow O’Humanity -- 2 Listen Share Let’s start this post rightwhere we left off with part 1— with a quick recap of Bostrom’s conclusions inSuperintelligence: that Human Level Machine Intelligence will definitely be developed at some point — probably within the next 60 years — and will rapidly self-improve to Super Intelligence which will be able to outsmart humans to achieve its goals. The best shot we have of programming the SI’s goals to avoid total existential catastrophe is to achieve international cooperation in SI development and then tell the SI to “achieve that which we would have wished the SI to achieve if we had thought long and hard.” I find this conclusion (and the entire book, really) to be quite terrifying. And, that was clearly Bostrom’s desired effect — to convince readers that the advance of artificial intelligence is an epically important topic that should be invested in and carefully studied. Bostrom is not shying away from fear mongering when he writes: “The first SI may shape the future of earth-originating life, could easily have non-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental reasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition” and will potentially create “a future that is mostly void of whatever we have reason to value.” “The first SI may shape the future of earth-originating life, could easily have non-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental reasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition” and will potentially create “a future that is mostly void of whatever we have reason to value.” As the first phase of my response toSuperintelligence, I’d like to run through all the ways that Bostrom successfully freaked me out. First, that “failure” meansirreversible existential catastrophe; as Bostrom puts it, we only experience an existential catastrophe zero or one times. Second, that we can fail in so many different ways — we can fail if the SI developers are evil, self-interested, or plain old ignorant. And the people who first develop SI will likely be the only developers of SI because the exponential rate of improvement after the crossover point means that the first SI that is developed will achieve a “decisive strategic advantage” over other projects. Really, we can fail insomanyways — in part 1 of this post, I listed a tiny portion of the dystopic possible outcomes that Bostrom lays out. “Failure” means irreversible existential catastrophe “Failure” means irreversible existential catastrophe The third thing that freaks me out is the general uncertainty surrounding this whole endeavor. Bostrom uses the qualifier, “assuming we aren’t totally oblivious to ___,” concerningly often. Bostrom’s vision of global cooperation seems highly uncertain when we consider the difficulty of reaching global agreements which limit an individual country’s military or economic strength. Also, the whole idea of telling the SI to do “that which we would have asked it to do if we had thought long and hard” is uncertainby design— it would mean creating an all-powerful entity with an unknown end-goal. The AI theorist, Eliezer Yudkowsky, calls this strategy Collective Extrapolated Volition (CEV) and describes it as: “Our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated; interpreted as we wish that interpreted.” “Our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated; interpreted as we wish that interpreted.” CEV is certainly an interesting, rather poetic idea, and one I would very much like to read about in a Kurt Vonnegut short story, but it is not something that I would like to bet human existence on. What do you think you would decide humanity’s CEV is after a quick read through of the entire internet? Remember in The Fifth Element when Leeloo (the supreme being sent to earth to save humanity) reads the internet to learn about humans and concludes, “What’s the use in saving life when you see what you do with it?”? And Bruce Willis won’t be around in 70 years to tell the SI he loves it in order to convince it that humans are worth saving… Also, the SI probably won’t be that into Bruce Willis. In addition to being uncertain by design, I find CEV to be a profoundly strange concept. Bostrom spends much ofSuperintelligencearguing that humans are greedy and stupid, and therefore we should give as much control as possible directly to the SI rather than to human monitors (this is one of Bostrom’s arguments against making an “oracle” SI that would tell humans what to do rather than decidinganddoing all on its own). But, with CEV, the SI will carefully examineallof the greedy and stupid humans and all of their greedy and stupid actions throughout history; and from this we expect that the SI will extrapolate a volition that is neither greedy nor stupid? Aside from this contradiction, CEV is just so maddeningly technophilic and pessimistic about human capabilities — by choosing CEV we are saying, “as ignorant, irrational, fallible beings, we really shouldn’t be in charge of our own future… so let’s create a purely rational, all-powerful entity to make decisions for us!” While I often feel pessimistic after reading the morning news, I am not quite ready for our species to collectively throw in the towel and call in robot reinforcements. What if, after reading the internet, the SI were to decide that humans fear death most of all and would therefore like to live forever? The SI might then digitize all human minds, allowing humans to survive indefinitely in uploaded forms. While an SI might surpass human cognitive capabilities in almost all arenas, I worry that the SI will not be able to factor into its calculations the idea that humanness is inextricably linked with an attachment to our imperfect, inefficient, mortal bodies. Point being: with an SI overlord, we would lack the most basic form of common ground. On a related note, that claim I just made about humanness being inextricably linked with an attachment to our imperfect, inefficient, mortal bodies is something that Bostrom would definitely contest. InSuperintelligence, Bostrom categorizes the immortal, digitized human minds scenario as a positive outcome. He also directly addresses my claim in a response to an essay about thedangers of transhumanismwritten by Francis Fukuyama. In this essay, Fukuyama writes: “For all our obvious faults, we humans are miraculously complex products of a long evolutionary process — products whose whole is much more than the sum of our parts. Our good characteristics are intimately connected to our bad ones… Even our mortality plays a critical function in allowing our species as a whole to survive and adapt.” “For all our obvious faults, we humans are miraculously complex products of a long evolutionary process — products whose whole is much more than the sum of our parts. Our good characteristics are intimately connected to our bad ones… Even our mortality plays a critical function in allowing our species as a whole to survive and adapt.” InBostrom’s response, he calls Fukuyama a “reactionary bioconservative” and says that the concept of a human essence is “deeply problematic.” I do not intend to start a philosophical discussion about human essence in this post — rather, I’m trying to demonstrate that Bostrom does not share my personal beliefs on the subject. And, I would postulate that many artificial intelligence experts are more closely aligned with Bostrom than with myself. So, not only would the SI overlord and I not have any common ground, but I might not share much common ground with the SI creators either. Even if we do achieve (miraculous and unprecedented) global cooperation in creating an SI, experts would be making goal-setting decisions. This adds a whole new category to our “we can fail in so many ways” topic; one person’s vision of SI success might be seen by another person as SI failure. So — I’m freaked out bySuperintelligencebecause we can “fail” [cause irreversible existential catastrophe] inmanyways; because we face uncertainty at every turn; and because these hugely important decisions about humanity’s future are going to be made by a robot or by humans who do not share my values. Not only do these things freak me out — I find them to be wholly unacceptable. While Bostrom would say something like, “tough noogies — that’s how it’s going down,” (or the equivalent in Swedish slang) I would respond, “No way Nick! We have to come up with something better.” More eloquently put, I’d like to challenge Bostrom’s assertions that halting SI development is impossible. And I plan to do just that inpart 3of this series.",LeeAnn Felder-Heim,https://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page---byline--6b9cbeddbd54---------------------------------------,7,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg,2019-01-02T04:07:36.403Z,Medium

Cook,"Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- 1 Listen Share Pipes deteriorate deteriorate and may need to be inspected. Fortunately, robots are available for this job, meaning humans don’t always have to be directly involved in this labor intensive and even dangerous task. These robots, however, are extremely expensive.This project aims to constructan alternative to those that are on the market, with a structure that can adapt to pipes of various diameters. The robot that the team came up with uses a pair of three-wheel roller assemblies arranged at 120 degrees for contact along the pipe’s inner diameter. Each wheel is attached to a linkage assembly that connects it to a central spring, designed to contract and expand as necessary to maintain pressure on the pipe, even if the diameter changes. For locomotion, two of the three front wheels are driven by powerful gear motors, pulling the rest of the robot with it. Control is accomplished via anArduino Unoand an L298N H-bridge board. As of now, it’s been shown to work well 300mm and 320mm horizontal pipes, and can roll like a car through larger diameters as well. One could see this type of design expanded in the future with three- or six-wheel drive and perhaps active control of the wheel linkages. This could then allow for better maneuverability or use in vertical piping.",Jeremy S.

The Plus offers double the power (10-watts) over the original and features an assortment of attachments that can be utilized for any number of projects. The Solderdoodle is outfitted with a high-efficiency, high-power charge controller and uses similar lithium-ion rechargeable batteries found in Tesla electric vehicles. With that said, the hot multi-tool has an hour of work time at maximum power (5000 C) before needing a recharge; however Isaac states that regular soldering sessions only last a few minutes long, so under regular use, the battery can last weeks on a single charge. Considering that the Solderdoodle is portable and charges over USB, you can tap into just about any mobile device power source if need be — portable rechargers, laptops, or even solar chargers if they happen to be available. As far as features go, the Solderdoodle is outfitted with a touch sensor that allows you to ‘swipe’ to different power levels, which is denoted on an LED power-level indicator. A switch on the back of the tool enables you to turn the tool on or off, and includes a safety mechanism that puts it in sleep mode when not in use. It is also compatible with a myriad of different tips — chisel, conical, wood burning, needle, spade, and blade, among others.

https://medium.com/@serena.golden_17349/more-or-less-alone-f5d9b21f3c6a?source=tag_archive---------137-----------------------,More or Less Alone?,Written bySerena Golden,"Serena Golden Follow -- Listen Share 7,674,374,208 is the number of people currently populating our modern world, yet millions have never felt more alone. We live in a hyperconnected generation in which we have the ability to contact another person instantaneously, whether he lives five minutes or five hours from us. The internet is a platform for unique individuals to relate to users who share common interests or hobbies. It is a place to stay informed about current events. It is a scaffold where human beings can learn, watch, or read about any topic they desire. Nevertheless, as the internet becomes increasingly accessible around the globe — connecting billions of strangers — users tend to put their best faces forward, concealing the reality of the somber emotions behind it. Sadly, this is one explanation as to why depression and suicide rates are higher than ever. With each new application on the market that promises happiness amongst users, society is being deceived into becoming more and more addicted to their phones. This sport, which consists of scrolling and streaming, spurs isolation from friends and family; thus leaving the most important type of connections — human interactions — as one of our lowest priorities. Between 2010 and 2016 the number of adolescents who suffered major episodes of depression and loneliness increased by 60%. This considerable growth can be attributed to the enslavement teens feel towards their phones since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Facebook in 2004, Instagram in 2010, Twitter in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011. Our overwhelming obsession with posting, liking, and scrutinizing every moment has gotten out of control. The new reality is that instead of watching concerts, we record them; in place of eating delicious meals, we photograph them; rather than joking with our friends, we tag them. Ultimately, we prefer to view life rather than experience it. As a teenager, I constantly hear my parents reminisce about the times they would play outside until sundown, only returning home to eat at the dinner table with their own parents. This may seem like a cheesy scene out of an old movie, but devoting time to spend with family (a tradition that many have given up on) used to be an integral part of many children’s lives. Research from the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that teens who allocate quality time for their families tend to lead happier lives. Despite this fact, young adults consistently give up sharing stories at the dinner table in favor of locking themselves in a dark room and binging-watching Netflix shows. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates for white and black children between the ages 10 and 17 have increased by 70% and 77%, respectively, between 2006 and 2016. Unfortunately, our generation withholds the knowledge necessary to take action and stop trends similar to these from developing, but we don’t know how to enforce it. What should be a simple task — setting down our devices and seeing the world with our own two eyes — isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Tech gurus specialize in pumping out new games and features that light up our reward centers, making it feel artificially good for us to zone into the harsh fluorescent screen. Yet, it is these Silicon Valley innovators who find themselves instituting tech-free homes for the sake of their children’s health and happiness. If the experts are also the ones who most fear the internet’s vast capabilities, shouldn’t that be a clear warning to change our habits? We used a tool designed to enhance our well being to aid in our mental destruction. It is our obligation to resist the seclusion of the omnipresent cyberworld so we do not miss out on the lives we deserve.",Serena Golden,https://medium.com/@serena.golden_17349?source=post_page---byline--f5d9b21f3c6a---------------------------------------,300,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg,2019-01-03T03:10:53.075Z,Medium

With devoted adherents developing, refining, learning and executingconcepts to deployed applications, every day we come closer to interconnecting technology and services, one block at a time. As more power house giants and governments target new avenues, blockchain continues to flourish at an exponential rate similar to other technologies, as previously witnessed. Without a doubt 2019 will be a fascinating year for everyone involved in blockchain, and as a blockchain solutions company, we say that with confidence. Here is a recap of the latest blockchain buzz last December. The Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) has formed a strategic partnership with the Russian based platform, Universa, a new generation of blockchain technology that emphasizes on tokenization and contractual agreements. Such initiatives entail a 10 year renewable strategic partnership, where ATI will be providing hosting services to Universa to facilitate further development. What objectives can be expected? ATI will develop value added services in the blockchain field, digital economy, and digitization of paperwork. Likewise, Universa will aim it’s efforts to develop additional applications and services to integrate them into new tech platforms, create e- certification and the digital economy. Together both parties will also build projects with BaaS (blockchain as a service), an initiative that includes digital currency, digital identity, as well as e-governance and smart cities. As blockchain captivates the interest of more government based entities, the push for solutions using blockchain based applications become fairly synonymous with identity management, digitization of documents, and overall governance to interconnect services and technology together. Clickhereto read the full article IBM Research and agtech startup Hello Tractor, a social enterprise that connects tractor owners and small holder farmers through a digital tractor sharing application, have developed an AI and blockchain based platform for Africa’s farmers. The pilot product is expected to deploy in 2019 with ongoing partnership co-financed by IBM and aims to support Hello Tractors’s business to connect small-scale farmers to equipment and data analytics for better crop production. The online platform will use a digital ledger and machine learning to measure, track and share data while“creating end-to-end trust and transparency across the agribusiness value chain”, according to an IBM release. Impressively enough,Digital Walletwill garner remote and IoT-based weather-sensing capabilities and AI to help farmers determine crops and inputs, choose when to plant and optimize and predict crop yields. IBM and Hello Tractor’s Digital Wallet will also retrieve data from fleet owners entailing tractor use, track and predict repairs, servicing and build credit profiles to open bank financing for farmers. This Blockchain and AI-based solution is a step in the right direction towards tackling agricultural and the many complexities faced within its industry. Many different variables exist within the realm of processes and resources, which makes an application like Hello Tractor a great start to providing turnkey solutions, despite being a hairline aid within agribusiness.

Clients can expect a fully managed service that makes it easy to facilitate and manage blockchain networks. Furthermore,“Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions”,as quoted by Amazon Web Service. AMB (Amazon Managed Block) is currently in preview, and those already register with AWS can sign up. If approved, members will be able to create a blockchain network. Although companies like ConsenSys and IBM have initiatives to provide services like BaaS (blockchain as a service) already, AMB (Amazon Managed Block) will surely provide an advantage by being a bit more agnostic with framework options. Amazon is one of the leading companies in cloud services, and being able to provide blockchain as a service will only expand their scope of services as blockchain is set to soon scale the industrial world.

The court will deal with internet related cases to save time and reduce overhead costs of getting justice out of the system. Blockchain will be utilized as a means to store evidence, and will legally be recognized as a viable documenting method by judicial courts. The decision to make blockchain a form of storing evidence stemmed from a case in which the plaintiff, a company based in Hangzhou, sued the defendant, a Shenzhen-based technology firm for making publications of the plaintiff’s copyrighted material on it’s official website. The Plaintiff screen captured the website and sourcing codes of the defendant and uploaded them to the bitcoin blockchain. After investigations were conducted byHangzhou Internet Courtand ruled in favor of the plaintiff, it was later ruled that this form of electronic data would henceforth serve as a form of evidence in copyright infringement cases. The Hangzhou Internet Court is definitely taking the right approach in solidifying evidence in copyright infringement prevention using blockchain. This could very well set the tone for many entities and encourage those bodies to consider other methods of storing documents immutably, as well as the security of sensitive data.

A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen, as well as a standalone app, IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators. IGTV enables anyone to be a creator, not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally oniOSandAndroid, as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos, or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos, popular videos, creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content. IGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences, e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV. Instagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content, but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic, personalized curation and a narrower set of sources, Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web. On the other end of the spectrum, Snapchat has focused on heavy-handed curation for Discover, only working with chosen partners. But that means it can be tough to find something to watch that really resonates. The recent redesign drowns polished Discover video in rivers of friends’ Stories and semi-pro creators. And Snapchat has just 186 million daily users compared to the 500 million-plus Instagram has. That reach could lure in creators who want to build their brand and audience, as well as (although not finalized how) earn money from their content. I suggest that it take the form of pre-roll ads or mid-break commercials, with creators potentially earning a revenue share. This is all what Facebook was hoping to do with Facebook Watch, but that original video hub was filled with third-rate reality shows and documentaries that haven’t piqued the interest of the younger crowd. Facebook is a ubiquitous utility, but it’s certainly not cool any more (according to todays youth). It’s NBC. Here, Instagram has a chance to be the second coming of MTV but for the newer generation. As someone who aspires to be a product manager one day, I would love to meet with the team and the product manager behind IGTV.I strongly believe that IGTV is a success because it lives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and business.

https://medium.com/finterra/consensus-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-6bcd7ea6da68?source=tag_archive---------138-----------------------,Consensus: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake,Published inThe Finterra Publication,"Sara Mohammed Follow The Finterra Publication -- Listen Share One of the key features of blockchain is its consensus mechanism. Necessary for the distributed ledger to function is ensuring the entire network of participants collectively agree with the terms of the contract. The purpose of the consensus is to verify the validity of the information being added to the ledger, to prevent double spending and other invalid data from being appended to the blockchain and to keep the network from being derailed through forking. There are a number of different consensus mechanisms out there. The most popular are the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake systems. All of them aim to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem but none of them provide a perfect solution. What is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem The definition of the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is bestdefined on CoinCentralas “a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable.” The Byzantine armies surround a city, ready to invade but they need to attack at the same time. The city is not strong enough to fight back against the entire Byzantine army. But the Byzantine army will only win if they attack at the same time. To make a decision, the generals of each army have to send a messenger back and forth to deliver the message. If the messenger gets caught or sends the wrong message, the Byzantine army will fail. There is no way to guarantee the authenticity of the message. How do they create a trustless system that ensures victory in attacking the city? Proof of Work (PoW) The first solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem was with Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW). To verify a transaction and add it to a block, it needs expensive computation and mining. This has a number of problems as it consumes a high amount of electricity and energy worldwide. Companies running on PoW are not as decentralised due to the better opportunities given to individuals that have faster and more powerful ASICs. So bigger mining pool can team up with one another to launch a 51% on the network. Proof of Stake (PoS) Compared to Proof of Work, Proof of Stake is an alternative that requires less cost and energy. This mechanism achieves a general agreement on blocks while also retaining a large validator pool for security. Proof of Stake is based on validators staking and locking a number of tokens in escrow, thereby giving them the right to become a validator. With PoS, a validator can put his or her money in different chains without fear of punishment, a problem called “nothing at stake”. Blockchains likeFinterra’sGALLACTICBlockchain have already found a way to tackle this issue through a process called “token slashing”. If a validator is caught acting in a violating manner, their staked GTX (GALLACTIC’s tokens) are forfeit and destroyed. This model gives validators incentive to cooperate and refrain from acting in a malicious manner. Moving forward In any centralised system, a central authority maintains and updates a database. In comparison, public blockchains that operate as decentralised systems work without a single authority. They involve contributions from hundreds of thousands of validators who work on verifying and authenticating transactions that are taking place on the technology. This blockchain solution reduces risk of corruption and fraud. So, which consensus mechanism is the best? We can only leave that up to the individual, but PoS seems to be inching ahead until a more viable option surfaces.",Sara Mohammed,https://medium.com/@sara.moh.f2018?source=post_page---byline--6bcd7ea6da68---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png,2019-07-31T04:17:48.851Z,Medium

What are Some Definitions of Fintech?,"Published inCentre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship","CFTE Follow Centre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship -- Listen Share Fintech is changing the world of finance at a rapid scale. Here are a few examples: Credit Karma, a fintech startup barely exists 7 years ago, has now more than 80 million users in the US and Canada. Monzo, a mobile-only bank, becomes the most opened bank in the UK in a little more than 3 years. Yue Bao, the assets management wing of Alibaba, has over 100 billion-dollar assets under management in just 9 months after its launch. This brings to the question of what is fintech? The World Economic Forumdefines fintech as:“new entrants that promised to rapidly reshape how financial products were structured, provisioned and consumed.” EYadopts a more encompassing definition of fintech as:“organizations combining innovative business models and technology to enable, enhance and disrupt financial services”, emphasising that fintech is not only about early-stage start-ups and new entrants, but also scale-ups, maturing firms and even non-financial services firms. In the same vein,McKinsey & Companycharacterises fintech company as:“start-ups and other companies that use technology to conduct the fundamental functions provided by financial services, impacting how consumers store, save, borrow, invest, move, pay, and protect money.” Similarly,KPMGdefines fintech as:“a portmanteau of finance and technology” which includes (1) “businesses who are using technology to operate outside of traditional financial services business models to change how financial services are offered” and (2) “that use technology to improve the competitive advantage of traditional financial services firms and the financial functions and behaviours of consumers and enterprises alike.” Accenturestates that fintech is about using technological advances to improve financial services, emphasising that:“the ‘tech’ in Fintech is the emergence of brand new technologies, such as AI, blockchain, analytics and big data.” In other words, fintech represents not only a powerful force of disruption from startups and technology companies to the financial industry, but also digital transformation within traditional financial services firms. These include the application of technology such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and blockchain to offer superior services in sectors such as retail banking, asset management, insurance and compliance. In this age of digital transformation, mastering fintech becomes increasingly critical to have a successful career in finance. At CFTE, we have developed two executive fintech education programs designed for finance professionals, entrepreneurs, technologists and consultants to bridge the knowledge gap. Around Fintech in 8 Hoursis a structured course in 16 modules that teaches the essential concepts to understand the impact of technology in finance. CFTE developed the course with 4 experts who know the industry inside out. Our co-founder and senior lecturer, Huy Nguyen Trieu, has led the Oxford fintech Programme and the HKU edX fintech MOOC. AI in Financeis the first of its kind online course that dives into the specific application of artificial intelligence in finance. In AI in Finance, you will be able to learn from those who are building AI and from those who are implementing AI. These are AI CEOs, senior leaders from banks, investors and regulators who are driving the AI agenda around the world, from the US to Europe and Asia.

https://medium.com/@chuahcindy/how-to-maximize-the-usage-of-your-mobile-data-1508ec816b5f?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,How to maximize the usage of your mobile data?,Written byCindy Chuah,"Cindy Chuah Follow -- Listen Share Thrashing your mobile data every month? Good news to every mobile subscriber who has excess mobile data out there! Now, you have a choice! An international award winning start-up, Simplify, has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible, Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember, there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access. The company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income, tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming. Interestingly, Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota. If you fall under the first two categories, Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash, and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell, for example RM8/GB. Like Grab and AirBnB, Simplify will take 20% commission out of the total data revenue sold (p/s: the company needs it to maintain their server). No contract, no hidden cost, all you need is to sign up a PayPal account to start selling your unutilized bandwidth. All transactions are cashless. On top of that, connecting on Simplify is convenient as buyers are not required to key in any Wi-Fi password in order to access the Internet, as Simplify will connect you smartly on the fly. All you have to do is just to choose which connection has the strongest network strength, click it, and there you go! You’re connected. Fret not on the security of this app, because you are in safe hands of Simplify as the app double-encrypt your hotspot password in the phone, and it does not forward or store your Wi-Fi password on the cloud. Simplify takes security and privacy of their users as first priority. Smart, Seamless and Secure, as its name suggests, Simplify caters for convenience and security. Have you Simplify?

Luna Stars (LSTR) 토큰 관련 스마트 계약과 세일즈 플랫폼 코드를 마무리하고 초안을 제작하는 시간을 가졌습니다. 2월 1일에는 Luna 최소 실행 상품을 출시하고 LSTR 공매를 시작하였습니다. 토큰 판매와 관련된 다양한 기사를 보시려면여기를 클릭하세요. 저희 팀은 지리적으로 분산된 협업의 형태로 시작하였습니다. 상품 관리와 디자인 팀은 공매 후 뉴욕으로 옮겼고, 엔지니어링 팀은 세계 곳곳으로 나뉘어졌습니다. 본 엔지니어링 팀은 이백서에 소개된 Luna web앱을 개선하는 데에 주력했습니다. 더 자세한 내용은여기를 참조하세요. 저희는 여러 시간대에 있는 사람들이 함께 일을 할 때에 발생하는 문제들과 맞닥뜨렸습니다. 그래서 다음 단계에서는 핵심 기능 개발을 위해 한 장소에서 함께 일하는 것의 장점에 대해 더 생각해 보게 되었습니다. 고심 끝에 저희는 독일 베를린에 사무실을 열게 되었습니다 (자세한 내용은 아래를 참고하세요). 원격 개발자들의 도움을 받아 같은 시간대에서 일할 수 있는 현장에서 저희는 재능 있는 인재를 모집했습니다. 베를린에서 저희는 한 발 더 나아가서엔지니어링 매니저와 행정 보조를 채용하였으며,유럽 기반의 소프트웨어 개발 회사와도 계약을 체결하였습니다. 새로 꾸려진 엔지니어링 팀은 순차적으로 데이팅 앱 최소 실행 상품의 업데이트(v0.2,v0.3)를 출시하였습니다. 또한, 상품 출시와 함께 전송 속도와 상품의 구상을 전반적으로 개선하기 위해 다양한 인재 채용을 계속하였습니다. Luna 데이팅 앱 모델이 현존하는 데이팅 앱들의 어긋난 인센티브를 해결하고 균형을 맞추는 데에 성공했지만 앱 개발을 진행 하면서 저희 모델의 부작용을 발견하게 되었습니다. 전형적인 매칭 알고리즘의 낮은 한계점에 의해 제한된 모델이라는 점을 발견하였는데 이를 해결하기 위해 베를린과 뉴욕 팀 간의 브레인스토밍이 제품 연구에 중요한 부분을 차지하게 되었습니다. 더 나아가 저희가 세운 몇 가지 가정을 검증하기 위하여 ‘빠른 실패와 더욱 빠른 성공’을 모델로 하여 단시간에 유저 기반 실험을 진행하였습니다. 단기적인 테스트를 진행함으로써 여러 모델의 장기적 유효성을 알아보고 빠른 개선이 이루어 질 수 있도록 했습니다. 이 접근 방식은 곧 최종 결과가 미리 정해지지 않는다는 것을 의미합니다. 역으로, 저희가 사용자들에게 창출해낼 수 있는 가치에 기반한 결과라는 것을 뜻하지요. 이 원리에 기반하여, 엔지니어링 팀은 Castle 언컨퍼런스(참가자 간의 교류에 중점을 둔 자유로운 방식의 컨퍼런스)와 Block Seoul 컨퍼런스(자세한 설명은 아래 참조)에서 선보일 실험용 매칭 app, 두 개의 단기 프로젝트에 착수하였습니다. Castle 앱은 참가자 간의 친밀도를 높일 수 있는 사교 기능을 포함하였고 Block Seoul 앱의 경우에는 전문적인 환경에서의 네트워킹에 중점을 두었습니다. 위 프로젝트들을 진행하면서 저희는Luna 연결 엔진의 생성문법을 개발하고 정렬된 인센티브를 바탕으로 하는 매칭 앱들을 제안할 수 있었습니다. 이 제안서들이 점차 모양새를 갖춰가면서, 관리자들의 도움을 받아 저희는 사용자 테스트를 진행할 기능들을 추렸습니다.iOS와안드로이드에서 Luna 모바일 데이팅 앱의 최소 실행 베타 버전을 테스트 하실 수 있습니다. 현재 사용자 테스트가 진행 중인 다음 상품 초안의 중심이 될 기술을 기반으로 하며 확장성에 초점을 둔 백엔드 상품입니다. 저희는 상품을 확장하고 네트워크를 발전시키며 더 나아가 신기술을 테스트 하기 위해 5월에 열린 언컨퍼런스 형식의 행사인The Castle에 참가하였습니다. The Castle에서 저희는 행사 장소 곳곳에 설치된 블루투스 장치를 이용하여 혁신적인 지역 기반 위치 추적 기술을 적용한 앱을 선보였습니다. Castle 앱은 매칭 설문의 결과와 알고리즘을 이용하여 참석자들이 어디에 가장 많이 분포되어 있는지를 알려주고 참석자들 중 가장 잘 맞는 사람과 실시간으로 연결할 수 있도록 하였습니다. The Castle 컨퍼런스는 새로운 사용자들을 끌어들이 동시에 네트워크의 가치 창출을 통해 더 많은 사람들에게 다가가고 그들을 이해 하는 데에 큰 도움을 주었습니다. 결과적으로 저희로 하여금 사람들의 이목을 집중시킬 수 있는 저명한 인사들을 만날 수 있는 기회가 되었고. 한 단계 더 확장된 네트워크는 추후에 열린 Block Seoul 컨퍼런스에서 저희의 큰 자산이 되었습니다. 또한 테스트와 피드백을 통한 상품 개발에 크게 도움을 주었습니다. 9월 17일부터 9월 19일까지 Luna는 여러 분야에 걸친 블록체인 컨퍼런스인Block Seoul을 개최하였습니다. 해당 컨퍼런스에서는 전 미국국가정보국장 James Clapper 중장, 위키피디아 창립자 Jimmy Wales, 전 뉴욕 주 주지사 David Peterson 등 저명한 인사들의 강연이 있었습니다. Block Seoul은 현존하는 기술의 한계점을 확장하는 데에 뜻을 둔 다양한 투자자와 혁신가들이 참여 아래 동양과 서양을 연결하는 기술의 글로벌 대화의 장이 되고자 하였습니다. Block Seoul 앱은 컨퍼런스 참석자들에게 전문적인 네트워크 형성을 최대할 수 있는 강력한 매칭 필터를 선보였고 이후에 저희 엔지니어링 팀은 이 모바일 앱을 단 두 달만에 완성시켰습니다. 저희는 베를린의 엔지니어링 팀을 강화하는 동시에 뉴욕을 운영 팀의 베이스로 골랐습니다. 서양권에서 뉴욕이 가지는 문화적 중심지로의 역할과 국제적인 영향력이 뉴욕을 고른 가장 큰 이유였습니다. 저희 뉴욕 사무실은 행사를 위한 공간과 다양한 문화와 여러 사람들에게 도달할 수 있는 홍보를 위한 공간으로 사용될 예정이었습니다. 비록 커뮤니티를 확장하였고 저희의 전략과 관련해 가치 있는 피드백을 얻을 수 있었지만, 뉴욕이 가지고 있는 장점보다 베를린의 엔지니어링 팀과의 먼 지리적 거리에서 오는 단점 (빠른 상품 개발에의 장애물)이 더 크다는 결론을 내렸습니다. 그래서 엔지니어링, 상품 담당, 운영, 마케팅, 재무 부서를 더 명확하게 구분하고 각각 부서의 직원 수요를 파악한 후 11월에 베를린으로 모든 팀을 모았습니다. 또한 12월에 COO를 초빙하면서 (이 부분에 관하여는 오는 1월에 더욱 자세한 업데이트가 있을 예정입니다) 운영진 채용을 마무리하였습니다. Qtum 블록체인의 훌륭한 환경과 활기 넘치는 커뮤니티와 함께 할 수 있는 건 감사한 일이지만 블록 체인은 상대적으로 작은 신생 커뮤니티입니다. 여기서 발생하는 문제에는 크게 두 가지가 있었습니다. 첫째로 QRC20을 위한 Ledger 인터페이스, Metamask와 같은 암호화폐 지갑 솔루션 등 저희가 사용하고 싶었던 툴을 조정하고 변경해야 하였습니다. 또한 저희는Status.im의 메시지 기술과uPort.me의 아이덴티티 기술 등 다른 프로젝트들의 인프라를 사용하고 싶었지만 앞서 말한 문제가 있었기에 그러한 부분들을 포기할 수 밖에 없었습니다. Luna Stars 토큰은 Ethereum의 더 큰 커뮤니티와 시스템과 이용할 수 있는 더 많은 툴을 손에 넣을 수 있는 기회입니다. LSTR 토큰 교환에 관한 자세한 사용설명은여기에서 찾으실 수 있습니다. Telegram 채널을 통한 적극적인 지원을영어와한국어로 제공하고 있습니다. 현재 저희는 아래와 같은 인재를 구하고 있습니다. 소프트웨어 엔지니어 2–3명 상품 관련 부매니저 1명 UI (유저 인터페이스) 디자이너 1명 소프트웨어 엔지니어의 경우에는, 관련 분야에서의 사전경험이나 특정 프로그래밍 언어와 체계를 다루는 능력보다 문제 해결과 커뮤니케이션 스킬이 더 중시됩니다. 베를린에서 일할 수 있으시고 이 좋은 기회들에 대해 더 알고 싶으시면, 여기를 눌러주세요.",Luna 🌙,https://medium.com/@lunalabs?source=post_page---byline--c99aaa71e99c---------------------------------------,1,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.,2019-01-02T14:45:43.897Z,Medium

I was the co-founder of Medium Blue, a B2B Search Engine Agency. Sure I was a nice guy. I served people, tried to do the right thing. I loved networking as much as the next guy, but a “prayer breakfast”? Come on. That’s what the Holy Rollers, Bible Thumpers, Street Preachers, and Jesus Freaks do. High Tech Ministries is hosting their annual prayer breakfast October 12th in Atlanta. You may be attending, you may have been invited, or you may never have heard of it. Either way, I wanted to share my story about it. Bo Simmons invited me to my first one 15 years ago. I wasn’t interested in Jesus, I had fallen away from the church after middle school, but the networking seemed like it would be good. The next year Kathy Jaques invited me and I heard a great speaker, saw some friends I haven’t seen in a while, and went back to work. The next year Andy Williams invited me to sit at his table. They gave each of us a little pocket-sized Gospel of John, which I politely put in my suit pocket. It would stay there for another two years until I found it while taking the suit to the dry cleaners. I was depressed, lost, hopeless, and looking for a way out. I had been essentially forced to sell my share of the agency, had more money in the bank then I ever thought I’d have, and went from being with people 50 hours a week, to sitting completing by myself with the shades lowered in a tiny room for months after the sale. I was searching for answers. Zen, Wayne Dyer, Oprah, Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff, meditation, you name it. While reading that Gospel of John in my hand on a front stoop of a building in Tucker, searching HARD for an answer or way out of my misery, I felt an almost PHYSICAL rush go through my body, like a freight train passing me by. I had never experienced anything like it before or since. At that moment in tears, and quietly, but outloud I said “God it’s yours. I’m yours. I’m tired of running from you. I’m tired of hiding from you. I’m tired of trying to do things my way, to please others. I surrender.” It wasn’t just that book, or those invites to the prayer breakfast. It was my parents and so many others raising me in a loving Christian home and church, it was God putting guys in my life like Kevin Shaw, Art Foster, Dale Huff, Dan McDade, that took the time to answer questions I had, or demonstrate the love of Christ. Looking back I realize God was pursuing me along. Being a Christian has been no bed of roses, I have more questions now then when I started. Why are “christians” so full of hate, selfishness, divisiveness? Why don’t ‘christians’ act and sound more like Jesus? Why are so many churches ran like businesses and enterprises? Why does our country have so much when, others have so little, when our country has all but turned our backs to God? Following Jesus can feel like walking on a tightrope with a 100 MPH wind and no safety net. Having a personal relationship with the living Jesus, is the ONLY thing that keeps me going. And it’s only in Him that I’m content and satisfied and at peace in NOT knowing the answers to all the questions. If this all sounds like rubbish and nonsense. I completely understand. It would have to me too. All I can tell you is when I sought Him, He found me. When I knocked, He answered. It wasn’t the knock of a curious thinker, or a cynic or a skeptic, or someone looking for a magic bullet, I had knocked all those ways over the years. It was the knock of a broken and empty heart who finally admitted that he needed a Savior. If you’re still reading this, it’s probably because you were meant to, it’s no accident. If you can make it tothis year’s breakfast, DO IT. Whether you think it’s stupid or not. Whether you think you’re too busy or not. And if you are a follower of Christ and reading this, there are people in your life you know don’t have a relationship with Jesus, PLEASE invite them. They may think it’s stupid, but they won’t thinkyou’restupid, only that you care enough about them to have invited them. YOU may be one that God wants to use. Don’t worry about what happens, you may never know the outcome or result in this lifetime. I’m grateful that through technology and testimony, I can witness and give thanks to some who took the time and care that led to not only my salvation, but my calling to ministry (and that’swhole other story). What is it that God may be wanting you to know about this? Turn away from the screen, take 3 deeeeeepp breaths and ASK Him. Even if that sounds stupid :) Peace and love, Todd",Todd Miechiels,https://medium.com/@toddmiechiels_79538?source=post_page---byline--83bef7723566---------------------------------------,41,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*3t9NIav-ncwKc0pq.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*3t9NIav-ncwKc0pq.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*3t9NIav-ncwKc0pq.png,2019-01-02T21:38:35.943Z,Medium
https://medium.com/21cb/2018-moments-we-a562438f1d3e?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,2018 MOMENTS WE ❤,Published inTwentyFirstCenturyBrand,"TwentyFirstCenturyBrand Follow TwentyFirstCenturyBrand -- Listen Share 2018, what a year indeed. We opened our eyes for the first time as a company to a whole planet actively taking massive strides at being a kinder and more accepting place to live. In an effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all. Here is our official 2018 review inspired by our values: We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it. 1.)Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way.Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right. 2.) 2018 was the year of women in action.From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history. 3.) Culture creators used releases as platforms to speak their point-of-view not just sell albums.Meek Mill launched his new album “Championships” yet spent all his airtime talking about criminal justice reform. And the First Step Act was passed (a criminal justice reform bill). We go out of our way to create a safe space for people to be vulnerable, creative and challenging. To be themselves, not who they think they ‘should’ be. 4.) Enough is enough.The students of Parkland became the faces of their generation as they rallied a nation and actively challenged government leaders and the NRA to protect our kids. 5.) We don’t have to think the same to love the same.Obama’s speech at John McCain’s funeral showed us how we don’t always have to see eye-to-eye to love and honor each other as human beings. 6.) Commercial beauty is a cage that must be broken.Korean women and men took a public stand against the extreme cultural beauty standards by starting the “Escape The Corset” movement. Commerce is predicated on growth but not all that grows is good. We pursue growth that is sustainable for people, the planet and profit. 7.) Artist expression is limitless when you are Donald Glover.His release of “This is America” under Childish Gambino proved you can maintain creative integrity in a multitude of verticals. 8.) If we learned anything from the past 5 years…ignoring sexism and racism will completely and totally slaughter your brand.Starbucks swiftly responded to racism by closing over 8,000 of its stores on May 29 to conduct unconscious bias training of its employees. 9.) We didn’t know that butterflies could go through metamorphosis to become even more glorious butterflies until Michelle Obama.Her release of Becoming solidified her role as a cultural leader and not just the forever queen of the White House. We see creativity as a mindset not a discipline. The art is in using it to create real value, with the entire company as our canvas. 10.)

Both heavy smoking, and more recentlylow-intensity smokinghave been linked to increased occurrences of death in various populations. It has also been said that “sitting is the new smoking”, that sedentary behavior is just as bad for one’s health. Internal studies conducted by our data science team have shown that sitting, is actually in fact worse. Vivametrica’s founders have been studying the effects of physical activity on health and chronic disease for over 20 years, this research has been the basis of our proprietary risk analytics. More interest in studying the impact of sedentary behavior on human health has arisen. Sedentary behavior has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients withChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Another study, which looked at the combined effects of watching TV with smoking found these factors to be co-morbid incancer-related mortality. Vivametrica conducted a study using 10-year mortality data to compare our risk prediction model to a traditional insurance risk model (>2000 person sample). The initial data sample, including wearable device data, was collected 10 years ago. As part of this study, we also performed individual variable assessments to determine the effects of specific factors on mortality. Steps-per-day (habitual physical activity) was the strongest predictor of mortality. Individuals who took fewer steps than the average for their age and gender were 5.4x more likely to die after 10 years compared to those who took more steps. When we looked at smoking status alone, we found that smokers were 1.2x more likely to die after 10 years compared to non-smokers. From these results, it can be said that physical activity has a greater impact on overall all-cause mortality than smoking in this study. Thus, increasing efforts to modify sedentary behavior with smoking cessation can help people to live longer. Getting people to move more seems to have an even bigger impact than stopping cigarette use.

https://medium.com/@ArableLabs/towards-a-more-digital-dense-smallholder-farmer-208903034ce2?source=tag_archive---------68-----------------------,Towards A More ‘Digital-Dense’ Smallholder Farmer,"A discussion on field data, technological value chains, and a worm’s-eye view of the global future of agriculture.","A discussion on field data, technological value chains, and a worm’s-eye view of the global future of agriculture. Arable Follow -- Listen Share Solidaridadis a nearly 50 year-old global network that focuses on sustainable production in 13 commodity groups, 11 of which are in agriculture. Based in nine regional hubs over 40 countries, they work with small- and medium-scale farmers growing crops such as sugarcane, fruit & vegetables, cotton, soybeans, and wheat & barley. These farmers are embedded in tight supply chains, and recognize the advantage to tracking all quantifiable aspects of their production, not only for their own edification, but for downstream buyers and consumers seeking demonstrable quality through traceability. Arable’s Jess Bollinger spoke with Mandla Nkomo, Managing Director of Solidaridad Southern Africa, about digital agriculture’s role in empowering small-scale farmers to build their knowledge base and make informed, data-driven decisions about their livelihoods and the goods they produce. Arable Labs: Mandla, before working at Solidaridad, you worked with farmers at TechnoServe. Can you tell us more about your background, and how long you’ve worked in agriculture? Mandla Nkomo:I am very passionate about two things: getting agriculture production right, and making sure we are creating opportunities for smallholder farmers to participate in global value chains. In other words, making it inclusive. I am actually a biochemist by training, with no formal training in agriculture, but agriculture has always been a passion. I started out working in a laboratory at an agriculture company, which allowed me to do both. When I transferred to Technoserve, I already knew, practically speaking, how integration works, and what the end user should do in terms of packaging the connections. Technoserve allowed people to do it at scale, across a number of companies and a number of value chains. Now I’m doing the same at Solidaridad, with a sharper focus on sustainability and value chains, and how digital can be leveraged. AL: Can you give us some background on the goals of Solidaridad? MN:Solidaridad has been around for 50 years, transitioning quite a bit from supporting activist movements in Central America towards supply chains in commodities. Looking at coffee, cocoa, and sugarcane, these are all big, global supply chains. We strongly feel that the current production system in the world is unsustainable; if we are going to deliver food for 9 billion people, things cannot go on business-as-usual. When we look at supply chains, we look at everything we can leverage, focusing on the core pillars of sustainability and inclusivity. They are important in defining everything about how we interact with that sector. AL: Textiles are outside core agricultural commodities, but are included in Solidaridad’s mandate. Why is that? MN:Textiles use a large amount of water and energy; we can make these more efficient. Same with the gold sector and mining. If we participate in creating standard operating procedures, we can add value to making those sectors sustainable. AL: How do you scale this efficiency globally? MN:When we did our MASP [Multi Annual Strategic Plan], one of the things that became very clear was that we needed to have a clear digital strategy, or we would not be in existence. This allowed us to bring in Shungu Kanyemba, Director of IT at Solidaridad, helping us integrate digital tools. I don’t have to preach this to you: digital is a great equalizer. It makes the world flat, and shines the spotlight on areas often left out. Where we previously had to rely on third- and fourth-hand information, now we have direct information. It’s very clear to us that it doesn’t matter which vertical you are looking at: everyone is adapting to a digitally enabled way of doing business. The investment we are making in terms of hardware, partnerships, and software — when you and I first met, we talked about how to make complex technology available at the bottom of the pyramid where it is going to have the greatest impact in changing things. AL: Where do you see change happening first, and how? MN:I’m glad you asked that. If you look at the value chain from start to finish, almost every activity lends itself to improvement using technology. We’ve been busy trying to integrate a number of tools to make a ‘digital-dense’ smallholder farmer. We want to know stuff about a smallholder farmer that he doesn’t know about himself. Worm’s-eye stuff. Stuff below the surface: nutrients in the soil, humidity in the soil. Previously this wasn’t possible, or if it was possible, it was very inefficient. AL: Where do you see room for the most improvement through technology? MN:A good example of this is soil testing, usually the domain of government institutions. If you are a farmer of any size, you are going to take a sample and ship it a couple hundred miles to some unknown place, where they do the test and in six months you get your results. Most input support programs are not based on fundamentals like how many nutrients are in the soil; it’s just a generic fertilizer recommendation. This leads to underapplying, overapplying, or applying fertilizer that never gets in the crop — which is expensive! Now, we have the ability to test in 15 minutes, and to let the farmer know the status of his soil composition and pH balance. We go a step further and make crop recommendations best suitable for his soil based on the results. If the farmer insists on a particular crop, we will give recommendations on the type and quantity of fertilizer necessary for that particular crop. This enables farmers to make data-informed decisions at the planning stage, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of their yield. We are working with 40,000–50,000 farmers in South Africa, testing the soil and ensuring that they all have access to this data. AL: That’s a great example of innovation as an empowering, real-time decision tool, rather than a mechanism that keeps farmers dependent on technology to interpret what is happening in front of them. MN:Let’s talk about the Arable Markwe posted on Twitter. This Mark is located in rural Zambia, next to a weather station contraption that requires 10 square meters to set up and has all types of instructions. Meanwhile, the little Arable Mark is doing all types of data calculation. I asked the site operator: When is the last time you got data from the weather station at this site? And he said they’ve never seen the data from that station. But with the Arable Mark, I could go online and immediately see the data from the past 24 hours. He was just blown away. Using open source satellite technology, we now have the tools to provide deep insight to help decision-making at the smallholder farmer level. AL: That’s especially important in Africa. MN:Yields on the African continent are still quite sub-optimal; we can change that with what we’ve got in our hands right now. If we could deploy 100,000 Marks in South Africa, we would have the most comprehensive view of weather in South Africa. If that information is shared with extension officers, we would have farmers planting at the right time. If we had information about plant health and disease incidence earlier, we could act. We wouldn’t have to wait for an extension officer to get on a bike and ride out to check on the field. We have the tools now — it’s on us to use them. AL: Tell us what you think the next generation of farming looks like. Who are the key players besides the farmers themselves, and what are their roles? MN:Solidaridad is building strategic partnerships with knowledge institutes in South Africa, such as theCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research. We work to create a pathway to allow their technologies to be tested in the field. Also, working withZambia Agriculture Research Institute, we have offered ourselves as a conduit for not just digital but biotech and breeding technology to reach the field. Secondly, we are creating internships for students in agricultural colleges and institutions to work with us alongside smallholder farmers. They read textbooks about how agriculture is done in the US, and work with us in integrating technology in the field. AL: Is this part of your rural ‘agropreneurship’ model? MN:This model is the delivery method for all these technologies. Whether it’s improved seeds or deploying Arable Marks, you need a purveyor. We see this as a great opportunity to connect young people, who are already digitally fluent, both financially and socially. Just look at pictures from the field where Shungu’s team is training farmers on some of the apps that we have built for them. AL: From the buyer’s standpoint, what are the biggest risks in purchasing products from smallholder farmers? How does digital agriculture help to reduce those risks? MN:For me this is where it’s quite exciting. We’ve got one of the big food processing companies in South Africa buying $1Bn of commodities. They can do all the planning in the world, but they are always let down by the lack of information from growers. If the crop is going to be late, it impacts how they set up their processing plant and logistics. They don’t know until it’s too late. They were very clear to us that the ability to use independently verifiable information makes a huge difference to them. They want to manage their portfolio of suppliers using soil information, Arable Mark data, and farmer input. When we add in possibilities with the insurers and bankers, it becomes even more exciting. We are running a model with the Marks in Mozambique with an agro dealer selling seed, providing both the dealer and insurer weather data that validates Sentinel data. Instead of having general insurance, we have precision insurance. Currently, insurance will cover people within 4-5 microclimates receiving the same level of insurance, but they are not experiencing the same loss. The Arable Marks provide more specific information, allowing them to have better data and greater efficiency in the insurance system. AL: Solidaridad is a global network. What has your experience been in the Southern Africa region? MN:We’ve got acentral officein Johannesburg, then have satellite offices with field staff that provide field support in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. We are driven by this one thing: the issues we are trying to solve are ancient. I spent time in a part of Zambia where there is massive deforestation because people harvest the trees to manufacture charcoal, which they then sell in the city for people needing energy. This is not the type of problem you can solve slowly: it’s urgent. Guess what one of the drivers is: agriculture is not paying farmers well, because their yields are sub-economic. At the basic level, they are applying fertilizer while not knowing what the soil needs; they don’t know the rainfall or the proper planting dates. The longer it takes to digitally enable these farmers, the longer we are going to have these deforestation issues. It’s not a ‘nice to have’ to play around with these Marks. It’s urgent. We can see the potential danger if agriculture does not change in Africa.

In an ever more globalized economy, being able to give customers global solutions is no longer an option, it is a requisite. Whole Bank would like to take away the stress and lack of clarity that often comes with paying for things internationally. Whole Bank looks to do this while maintaining their high standards of personalized customer service. Our interviewees ranged from young professionals traveling on business and pleasure to retirees traveling for cultural experiences and family visits. Although their motives for travel and their spending habits varied, we found 5 similar topics arise in most interviews. Commissions, Fees, and Conversion Rates Credit Card Points, Rewards, and Benefits Card Accessibility and Vendor Acceptance Budgeting Robbery and Safety Most interviewees indicated that their biggest concern wasavoiding extra fees and bad conversion rateswhile traveling. We decided to focus on this issue while creating an app design for Whole Bank. We came up with several solutions to avoid extra fees and commissions. We focused on 2 specifically: Clarity regarding conversion rates of currency An easy way to compare different card fees and benefits side by side We created a process that quickly educates the consumer about the country’s conversion rate through a visual aid. From there, the consumer is brought to their digital wallet where they can see their various card providers at a glance. This was an important solution we thought we could easily incorporate as many consumers said card acceptance was an issue. We wanted consumers to easily be able to tell if their card was Visa, AMEX, Mastercard, etc. While in their wallet, the client can slide out a card to see the full card details or to make a payment. Each card will show details regarding fees, points, and conversion rates. Almost all interviewees indicated that they found it necessary to carry at least some cash on hand. For this reason we also included an ATM finder option. The ATM finder would work with Google Maps and show pins in green, yellow, or red depending on the ATM’s fees and conversion rate. One important comment from an interviewee was,“I like the personal attention I receive from my bank.”We wanted to ensure that consumers felt taken care of, even while using a mobile app. We tried to convey this sentiment through the tone of the copy and through the inclusion of a live chat that connects consumers to a bank representative. I found this challenge fun and also eye-opening. There were several key points I took away from the experience. 1. The prototyping process is much more involved than I expected! Realistically, my prototype needed to include many more screens. There were certain features that I did not draw out a screen for. For example, the button that indicated “€ -› $” would have “flipped” to show the digital wallet in the user’s home currency. 2. There are certain features that I don’t know how to communicate through a prototype sketch. I had many features that in my mind seemed intuitive but I wasn’t really sure how to communicate them on a sketch. For example, I wanted a haptic response when a user has selected and is sliding out a credit card in the digital wallet. How can I communicate that in a sketch? Similarly, there were certain screens I wanted to fade in and out. I didn’t know how to convey that through a sketch. 3. When is it necessary to explicitly put something in writing for the consumer and when is it visually more pleasing to leave it up to intuition? For example, I first considered not including the button that indicated “€ -› $”. I thought I would just have the consumer click their amount total in their account and have the screen “flip” to the other currency. However, I wasn’t sure if this would be intuitive for most users, so I included a separate button. After showing the prototype sketch to one of the participants, she commented, “There are too many screens before I get to my wallet. I want to be able to just log in and go.” I wasn’t sure if this was just one consumer’s opinion or if I needed to pare down the instructions at the beginning. All in all I found the process gratifying. When I “finished” the prototyping I wanted to continue developing different ideas. I look forward to tackling more projects!",Haley Kirk,https://medium.com/@uxbykirk?source=post_page---byline--3863d45fee46---------------------------------------,45,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*_3EijxXgs7XdnY1kj3nT7g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_3EijxXgs7XdnY1kj3nT7g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_3EijxXgs7XdnY1kj3nT7g.jpeg,2019-01-01T00:27:59.299Z,Medium
https://medium.com/syncedreview/instagan-excels-in-instance-aware-image-to-image-translation-64fb7d0344ae?source=tag_archive---------34-----------------------,InstaGAN Excels in Instance-Aware Image-To-Image Translation,Published inSyncedReview,"Synced Follow SyncedReview -- Listen Share Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Pohang University of Science and Technology have introduced a machine learning algorithm system, InstaGAN, which can perform multiple instance-aware image-to-image translation tasks — such as replacing sheep in photos with giraffes — on multiple image datasets. The paperInstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translationhas been accepted by the respected International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2019, which will take place this May in New Orleans, USA. An image-to-image translation system is a system that learns to map an input image onto an output image. Unsupervised image-to-image translation has garnered considerable research attention recently in part due to the rapid development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that now power the technique. Previous methods were not suitable for challenging tasks, for example if the image has multiple target instances or if the translation task involves challenging shapes. Last month Google AI researchers introduced a state-of-the-art model capable of realistically inserting an input object in a photo with both a reasonable position choice and an accurate prediction of the output object’s size, pose, shape, etc. The team behind InstaGAN, however, believed even this advanced method could be improved upon. This new research is based on CycleGAN, a GAN variant which can learn to translate images without paired training data to overcome the limitations of one-by-one pairing of pix2pix in image translation. CycleGAN can automatically translate two given unordered image sets X and Y, but it cannot encode instance information in an image. CycleGAN results however are not ideal when translating images involving specific features of the target. The InstaGAN system overcomes this problem and combines instance information from multiple task targets. InstaGAN combines the boundaries of the target while ignoring details such as colour. Compared to CycleGAN for image-to-image translation, InstaGAN is more successful in generating a reasonable shape for the targeted instance while preserving its original context. The research has been accepted as an ICLR 2019 Poster Paper. Reviewers indicated the method was novel and solved information problems not solved by previous methods with a clear explanation; that results looked significantly better than CycleGAN and other baselines; and called for additional controlled experiments with the model. The paperInstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translationis onarXiv; and more information is available on the InstaGANGitHub.

https://medium.com/@pumapay/what-is-a-dapp-584f199d13ca?source=tag_archive---------140-----------------------,What is a DApp?,Written byPumaPay,"PumaPay Follow -- Listen Share An entirely new breed of apps is gaining momentum, DApps. DApps are not owned by anyone, they run on the blockchain, and technically their backend code is running on a decentralized P2P network. Crypto pundits and the community defined criteria that a DApp needs to meet in order to be considered the obvious, a decentralized app. First, it must be open source and the source code of the app to be available to all network participants, and anyone can check and contribute to the code. Secondly, it has to use blockchain technology to record transactions which anyone can refer to at any given point. Thirdly, it needs to be fueled by tokens or digital assets. Lastly, it needs to generate tokens and have an inbuilt consensus mechanism like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). DApps propose a paradigm shift in the way we view software models. A world running on decentralized apps will be remapping the technological landscape. Why? Just because they are distributed, transparent and incentivized mechanisms open to all network users. The increasing development of DApps has opened up the possibility of an exciting new world, dominated by decentralized gaming apps likeCryptoRome,Endless DiceandSteem Monstersas well as token exchanges such asIDEX,BancorandKyber. On the contrary, not all crypto space-related apps survive or end up delivering on their technological ambitions. Although, the crypto environment has given a plethora of ICOs and ideas, over time these have faded. After the 2017–2018 hype in new ICOs, only few of the original and innovative projects survived.

The degree to which social media has been in play in our elections is mind-boggling, and only now seems to have become apparent. It’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media, asthis Atlantic article notes. But that was all warm-up compared to election 2016. Very early on Hillary’s army took to the trenches, making moves to gain an advantage.

The reason? In late 2018, the company announced plans to base one of its two new “headquarters” in Long Island City, Queens. Amazon’s leaders probably assumed that the decision would delight locals. After all, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was so keen to lure the company that he joined forces with his arch-rival Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, to offer incentives. But local residents have not reacted as the city elites — or Amazon officials — might have expected. Instead of welcoming the new high-paying jobs, some locals organised community meetings to try to keep Amazon out. As Tania Mattos, a leader at Queens Neighborhoods United, a group that ­promotes affordable housing in the area, ­told the FT: “This deal was not for our communities and, if it’s not for our communities, we’re not going to allow them into our neighbourhood.” How should companies respond?

https://medium.com/@LHammondWriting/time-travelling-taking-a-glance-at-the-state-of-wearos-in-2019-9158390e91b2?source=tag_archive---------122-----------------------,Time travelling: taking a glance at the state of WearOS in 2019,Design -,"Luke Hammond Follow -- Listen Share Ever since I was 12 I’ve walked the streets with a smartwatch on my wrist. Beginning with the original Sony Smartwatch, the idea of donning a piece of technology on my wrist was originally more of a statement to my inner techie than a helpful utility. As I grew with age and transitioned into more unconventional accessories such as the Omate Truesmart, I began to appreciate the power of having a tiny computer on my wrist. Fast forward 5 years and the smartwatch is still a minuscule niche in the watch and wearable market, dominated by (cough, cough), the Apple Watch. Google themselves attempted to pave the way back in 2014 with their Android Wear operating system, releasing it on devices such as the Moto 360 and LG Watch. Early devices seemed to favour function over form, but even then these slightly underpowered wearables soon became shadowed by Apple’s own offering. Re-branded to WearOS last year, Google’s operating system is favoured by more luxury brands such as Fossil, Tag Heuer and recently, the likes of Hublot and Mont Blanc. Their bid, to capture the hearts and minds of both techies and watch lovers alike. Their fiercest competition? The Samsung Galaxy Watch. After its own offering in Gear Live, Samsung veered away from the sinking ship of Android wear with the release of its highly renowned Gear S2 watch in 2015. Here Samsung revolutionised the navigation of such devices with a rotating crown and their intuitive Tizen operating system. The only problem was third-party app support. Three iterations later at the Galaxy Watch and we are still plagued with the same issue. Since September I have been wearing the 42mm Galaxy Watch on my wrist, and I’m more than impressed. Whether it the intuitive navigation, the useful widgets or the health tracking, the Galaxy watch is more than a contender in the smartwatch game. To try and keep up with the likes of Samsung and Apple, Google released WearOS 2.1 with an updated notification interface and new home screens emphasising a new focus on Google Assistant and the fresh-faced Google Fit. Over the past few weeks, I’ve removed my Galaxy Watch and booted up my Gen 1 Huawei Watch to see how this new visage of WearOS can be stacked up compared to its fiercest rival; here are my thoughts. Quick disclaimer:WearOS is best experienced on a newer device, so some of what I describe below may be different to that of current gen smartwatches. All of the comparisons I am making are my own opinions from my own experiences from the devices on hand to me. This is NOT a definitive guide to Wear OS vs Tizen. Quick disclaimer:WearOS is best experienced on a newer device, so some of what I describe below may be different to that of current gen smartwatches. All of the comparisons I am making are my own opinions from my own experiences from the devices on hand to me. This is NOT a definitive guide to Wear OS vs Tizen. As you can probably tell from the title of this piece, I’m slightly biased towards Tizen and think that WearOS is an ageing dinosaur, but then I am using it on a fossil like the Huawei Watch. Design - Despite being a good 2 years old, I still feel that my Huawei Watch is stunning with its stainless steel styling, more Omega than Computer. Ok, I did switch out my ageing leather band for a shiny new mesh one, but there still something about the more executive and dressy look that tickles my taste buds. I’m not saying I don’t like the look of the Galaxy Watch, and to be fair the Galaxy Watch is more of an active companion than an executive timepiece. My 42mm model comes in all black, with a rubber strap. This is beneficial as it means with its 5ATM water resistance and MIL810-G durability rating, this smartwatch can really take a beating. That’s one thing I like more about that Galaxy Watch; the fact that I don’t have to worry about it. With the Huawei Watch, I always felt I had to be careful with it, particularly on close encounters with water. Although it does have an IP67 rating, I just didn’t feel as comfortable as I do with the Galaxy Watch on my wrist, particularly when I had the leather strap installed. UI - Now you can’t talk about the Galaxy Watch without addressing it’s most raved about feature; the rotating bezel. Forget Apple’s digital crown, Samsung’s bezel is where it’s at. Nothing feels more natural than taking a twist and seeing the round UI on the screen twist with it. To match this, every aspect of the UI is based around this movement, with everything from app icons to the menus being circular. From the watch face, a twist of the crown takes you to your widgets on the right, and notifications on the left. The widgets help display a selection of information from apps, such as calendar events or your progress towards that day’s fitness goals, without having to enter the app itself. Navigation is smooth and simple, although the placement of the home (bottom) and back (top) buttons for some reason still confuses me. The old version of WearOS was clunky and slow; there was nothing really intuitive about it. A press of side button would take you to the app selector, and a longer press to Google Assistant. Through swiping left or right you could change your watch face, then up or down to view your notifications, and lastly down from the top to access quick settings. Functional, but nothing special. With the new update, Google attempts to address this by making better use of swiping gestures. Although the button presses achieve the same result, with a swipe from the right you are presented with a new Google Fit dashboard. This dashboard fits in line with the newly revamped Fit formula, presenting you with 2 rings showing your progression to your move minute and heart point goals, along with a running total of the how many steps you’ve made that day. Swiping to the other side, you can now find a new dedicated hub for everything Google Assistant. Similar to the Google Now of old, this hub presents you with everything you’ve got going on in your day, from calendar events and reminders to deliveries and flights (taken from Gmail of course). Notification Support - One of the main reasons why most people buy a smartwatch is for the satisfaction of feeling a little buzz on your wrist whenever an alert comes through on your phone, even if the phone itself is on silent. On the Galaxy Watch, one simple twist of the bezel to the left takes you to the list of notifications, and then a tap of the touchscreen takes you deeper. In the case of messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, this gives you a preview of the chat feed, and options to reply using the on-screen keyboard, voice dictation and even a selection of smart replies. With email apps such as Gmail, it allows you to read the entirety of the email, using the bezel as a scroll wheel. In comparison, WearOS uses the same tried and tested formula that has worked for them since the days of Android Wear. Notifications appear as a list which can be accessed by swiping up from the watch face. The list gives you a small preview of the app, the title and content of the notification, nicely accented by that app’s colour scheme as per Google’s material design language. Like the majority of smartwatch OS’, pressing into the notification you can read deeper into a notification’s contents and gain a few options for interaction as with the Galaxy Watch. At times the list as per WearOS can be a little clunky and messy, especially when there are more than a few notifications to scroll through. In comparison to Tizen, this functions in the largely the same way but actually benefits over the Galaxy Watch due to the full Qwerty keyboard, compared to the telephone keypad and awful predictive text used by Samsung. Overall, I haven’t really found any issues notification wise with either of the offerings, but then there aren’t really many places where they can go wrong. Battery Life - As I have found with most smartwatches, battery life is a very similar story. With my regular daily routine, and then switching the device off before bed I am usually able to get 2 days of battery life out of both devices. The efficiency of the Huawei watch battery has slightly dwindled over time, but then that is to be expected with all mobile devices; so all things considering, it is holding up pretty well. The place where the Galaxy Watch really triumphs is the battery saver. On my Huawei watch, the battery saver would usually only give me maybe an extra few hours of battery, allowing me to make it to bed without it dying on me; with my Galaxy Watch its a whole different story. At 15% battery, I get a notification warning me of my low battery and asking if I want to enable power saving mode. In this mode, the OLED screen is reduced to black and white, so only the bare necessary pixels are being lit. It also turns off lift to wake and limits the user to a simple watch face with time, date and steps. On top of this, app functionality is reduced to the phone app for any emergency calls. Despite the clear lack functionality, after forgetting to charge my watch the night before, I was still able to get a full days usage on under 15% battery, with 6% still left by midnight; by far this is one of my features of the Galaxy Watch. Fitness and Sports Tracking - One of the main reasons why the majority of people purchase wearable devices is to use as a fitness and sports tracker. Whether you’re a hardcore athlete looking for rich running metrics, or someone who simply wants to see how many steps they do, there is something for everyone. Despite having similar capabilities, in theory, this is one area in which the 2 devices clearly differ. The Huawei Watch mainly relies on using Google’s recently updated Fit platform. It provides the typical steps data and allows users to track a few cardio workouts including runs and bike rides. The service now also tracks its own new metrics of heart points and move minutes, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO), to give users a better idea of their weekly activity. Even though you can add workouts details after they have been completed, Google Fit is better suited to fitness novices and those who simply want steps and the occasional run. For those who are a bit more sport mad, the Galaxy Watch would be a preferable option; with the latest version of Tizen, Samsung continues with their work in the Gears Sport and Fit 2 Pro offering users a plethora of activities to chose from. From the pool to the bench press, the Galaxy Watch has you covered, being able to track over 30 different activities. Within each, providing metrics from calories and distance to reps and sets. Being not as active as I used to, I mainly use my Galaxy Watch for the more advanced fitness tracking, automatically recording my long walks and keeping track of my cycling in the gym. I have attempted to use the rep counting feature for exercises such as lat pull downs, but the watch never seemed to recognize my starting position. Whether this is to do with how I am moving my arms, or an issue with the watch I don’t know, but I will continue to test this for other exercises. Lastly, the addition of sleep and stress tracking makes the Galaxy Watch more compelling as a general health and fitness device. Metrics such as sleep stages mean that the Galaxy Watch is able to keep up with popular devices such as those from Garmin and Fitbit. Rich features such as these leave no room for my Huawei Watch to rival, hence I much prefer wearing my Galaxy Watch for day-to-day activity. Apps - One of the most compelling attractions of buying a smartwatch is the promise of third-party app support, allowing interactions with your favourite apps to complete tasks without having to take out your smartphone. Being the direct wearable counterpart to Android, WearOS has distinctly more apps found within its store than Tizen. From Any.do to Outlook, WearOS almost has it all, making it considerably more attractive than the Galaxy Watch in terms of app support as there is a higher chance the apps you love will be able to supply some sort of functionality on your device. What is attractive about the suite of apps found on the Galaxy Watch is the (almost) exclusive native support for some popular services that are yet to make their way to WearOS with the same functionality. For music lovers, Samsung are lucky enough to boast full Spotify support from streaming to offline services for those users with a premium subscription, and a more recently released app for Tidal users. Although these apps are not great (I have had a considerable struggle in getting the Spotify app working and have read some not so great reviews of the Tidal app), they do function and propose a feature that on WearOS is strictly limited to Google’s own Play Music service. In addition to music, Samsung also gives sport and fitness fanatics native apps for the entire Under Armour suite of apps, including a year of their premium service for all new users to the device, and Strava. As with the music apps, the extent of their functionality is that they work; none of them does anything particularly special, and in some cases are difficult to set up when logging into accounts, but some of that could be in part due to the fact I am using a OnePlus device and not a Samsung phone. The stock apps found on the device function far better than those from third parties; I frequently find myself using the timer when I am cooking and Samsung Pay to buy my Lunches. Being close to Android, app support is truly where WearOS triumphs over Tizen; it is clear that Samsung is trying to gain more support from third parties, but at the moment it’s not quite there. In Summary, Going back to using my Huawei Watch has been an interesting experience. There are still many features of the device that I enjoy using; the integration with Google Fits step tracking is perfect for my light day to day activity, and the more elegant design makes the timepiece appropriate for more dressy occasions. Despite that, I don’t think my Huawei Watch will earn a permanent spot back on my wrist. The Galaxy Watch is a great device, that marries a functional, yet still attractive, design with an intuitive UI. Notification support is as expected and the more advanced fitness features are on par, if not better than those offered by Google Fit; the addition of sleep tracking makes the device a serious competitor to the likes of Garmin and Fitbit. My only gripe with the device is the poor selection of apps and the fact that the apps it does offer work poorly or are a mission to set up. In fairness, I am probably using the wrong device with the Galaxy Watch, as a Samsung smartphone would open up a slightly wider selection of apps and functionality. Regardless of the issue with apps, I still prefer the Galaxy Watch due to its intense fitness features and intuitive UI resulting from the rotating bezel. In truth, WearOS is still a viable option for those using Android, with more current devices boasting NFC and a slightly better looking UI due to updated processing and memory. In the future, I hope both operating systems are able to improve and give users more powerful features and apps, but for now, I am going to keep the Galaxy Watch on my wrist, and will continue to do so until WearOS catches up.",Luke Hammond,https://medium.com/@LHammondWriting?source=post_page---byline--9158390e91b2---------------------------------------,0,11 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg,2019-01-02T19:38:31.144Z,Medium

Use this advice to land your first internship or job!,"Here are some steps I took to better myself as a candidate for a tech internship. Use this advice to land your first internship or job! Suprith Aireddy Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Getting your first internship is a big deal. It’s your foot in the door to your career in technology. This internship will help you tremendously to land your first job. After a year of developing my skills, I landed my first internship during my junior year of college. Now here are some things I did to better myself as a candidate. Attend Hackathons! For those of you that lack experience or personal projects, this is the number one step I recommend. Hackathons are open, inclusive, environments for people of all developer levels to better their skills. It’s where you meet up form a team and create a solution. This solution can be anything your team wants to build. Hackathons are a place to learn from mentors and other like-minded people in your community.

Many candidates simply get overlooked or lost in the system because they don’t have an effective resume. Here are some things to consider when creating your resume. Template I use this template right here and it has given me the best results. It’s simple, elegant, and clean. I recommend this template but as long as your resume has those three characteristics you should be fine. deedy/Deedy-Resume A one page , two asymmetric column resume template in XeTeX that caters to an undergraduate Computer Science student … github.com Make your name easily visible Recruiters have very little time to scan through the thousands of resumes they receive. By making your name big and bold, it will be very easy for them to remember who you are. This sounds simple but it’s very effective. Make your name the biggest thing on your resume. Include necessary information This is very simple. Remove anything on your resume that is not tech related. Remove the objective or summary. Recruiters tend to not read that at all. When listing previous experiences, highlight company names, positions andinclude graduation date. Important content should be higher up on the page. Again, use the template above for how to list information. Don’t make your resume a maze. Have clear outlined sections so that recruiters can see things without being overwhelmed. Include technical details. When listing experiences and projects, list things that you have impacted by your code. Did you improve run time by x amount? Give them quantified information. Having a personal website tells the recruiter that you are very passionate about coding. It shows them that you have the ability and skill to do things outside of a classroom setting. By creating a personal website you will stand out of the crowd and will be considered more than the other candidates. Apply Apply Apply! Getting your first gig is almost like a numbers game with a little bit of luck. When you don’t have the luxury of having a big network, it is very difficult to get interviews. That being said, I recommend you apply to as many job postings as you can. I applied to about 5–8 postings a day for about 2 straight months. I heard back from about 33% of them and was rejected without an interview for the rest. When applying, keep in mind tocater your resume to the job postings needs. Change your resume a little bit to better suit the posting and apply to jobs that are out of your comfort level. Keep in mind that most postings are just recommendations and not an end all be all application. Mostrecruiters look for students that are hard working and fast learners. They understand that you may not have all the skills needed and that is completely fine. Getting your first internship can be a struggle. However, with this advice, you will stand out from the crowd and will improve your chances of receiving your first offer!

https://medium.com/elemental-excelerator/5-ways-to-democratize-access-to-clean-energy-technology-elemental-excelerator-5d85f5babcf1?source=tag_archive---------142-----------------------,5 Ways to Democratize Access to Clean Energy Technology,Published inElemental Excelerator,"Elemental Excelerator Follow Elemental Excelerator -- Listen Share California recently became the second state topassa 100% clean energy standard, three years after Hawaii passed a similar law. As the fifth largest economy in the world, California has a tall order to fill in terms of making the transition to clean energy. How can California, and other states that wish to follow suit, fulfill this ambitious task? They will need to provide affordable, relevant, and accessible energy options to every one of its residents, prioritizing those who have historically been overlooked and left out of the clean energy conversation due to economic circumstance or social inequity. To reach this goal in a proactive way, at Elemental Excelerator, we have identified the following opportunities and tools to apply in our work: Place-based targets:Working in communities with 100% clean energy goals (or similarly ambitious goals in other sectors like water and mobility). Problem statements:A lack of access and/or slow adoption of technologies to reach these goals. Solutions:Education and outreach, customer and public-sector engagement, innovative financing models for technologies, and alternative options to meet community needs. Impact:Accelerate access to clean technologies for 100% of people by 2045. By strategically outlining targets, problems, solutions, and impact, we can more quickly focus in on where to deploy funding and resources. This has also helped us identify 5 ways California can democratize access to clean technologies: 80% of Americans do not have access to rooftop solar. Providing options for those who are locked out of the solar market — either due to renting, apartment restrictions, or lack of access to consistent solar energy — will be essential to achieving a clean energy future. Companies such asSolstice Power Technologies,Elemental Excelerator’s recent cohort company, are engaging customers with low-cost community solar options and working with community-based organizations to make the benefits of solar easy to understand. Another company,Arcadia Power, is building America’s first digital utility that allows consumers to switch to clean energy, and will be providing community solar as one of their main offerings. Building energy storage solutions in low-income communities increases resiliency and widens access to renewable energy sources. It allows property owners to better manage energy demand, thus lowering peak demand charges and their overall utility bills. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently widened the coverage of California’s virtual net metering tariff to include storage with solar systems. While still new, the concept of community energy storage has been introduced to allow greater access to renewable energy. Community energy storage has beenloosely definedby the California Public Utilities Commission as “storage connected at the distribution feeder level, associated with a cluster of customer load.” Community storage has the potential to mirror community solar in terms of the way it is distributed among customers in partnership with solar. InSacramento, the pilot project of the Anatolia III Solar Smart Homes Community consists of 15 residential batteries in connection with solar and three larger units. This helps to smooth customer load profiles and control the distributed sources of energy. Most recently, PG&Eannouncedthey will be replacing three natural-gas power plants with lithium-ion batteries from Tesla. This will be the largest installation of batteries in the world, and the first time a utility has replaced power plants with a renewable energy resource. Battery costs have been declining by as much as32%in 2015 and 2016, making them more accessible to a wider range of customers — both residential and commercial. The costs of other energy storage sources havedecreasedas well, including pumped hydro, flywheels, and flow batteries. Adding storage technologies to the proliferation of solar across America and the world will provide not only resiliency to the grid, but also a faster financial return due to the control over peak power demand. With more distributed and intermittent resources coming online, batteries will be a key resource to achieving any ambitious renewable portfolio standard. Older buildings are often the least energy efficient, costing residents (often low- to moderate-income ones) high electricity bills. Communities impacted by these high costs are also likely to be disproportionately impacted by pollution, and struggle with air quality issues due to their proximity to high-polluting refineries, freeways, and industrial activities. Efficient buildings and smart homes can enable a lower cost of operation in these communities, while also improving indoor air quality. BlocPower, a company based out of Brooklyn, New York and another Elemental Excelerator portfolio company, is aggregating blocks of buildings in financially underserved communities to provide energy efficiency audits and retrofits. By grouping buildings together, they lower the risk of project financing and offer discounts to fund the projects. This accelerates the timeline of installing energy efficiency projects beyond what each building would have been able to achieve alone. By lowering the total energy demand required to power buildings in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution, we can help improve quality of life, create cost savings for those who need it most, and reach a cleaner energy future faster. According to theBureau of Labor Statistics,transportation is the second largest consumer expenseafter housing. Many low-income communities have minimal access to reliable, affordable, and clean transportation. Providing alternative and affordable transportation options is key to not only achieving a clean energy future, but also to paving pathways out of poverty. BlueLA, an electric vehicle (EV) sharing company, was selected by the City of Los Angeles to operate a program that brings EV car sharing to low-income communities. Not only did the company begin operations in low-income communities, but it also offers discounted prices to low-income qualified customers. Kick scooters, bike shares, and scooters have exploded onto the streets and sidewalks of many major cities. But until now, these options have only been available to people with credit cards and smartphones. While smartphones have become more accessible, about50%of people with subprime credit scores do not have a credit card. New mobility start-ups are beginning to experiment with cash options that allow non-credit card owners to access their electric scooters and bikes. These scooters and bikes can provide critical last-mile options between commuters’ homes and places of work. In fact, oneUSC studyfound that shortening the time it takes to get to transit stops using methods such as e-bikes and scooters can double the number of jobs available within a 30 minute commute. Private corporations and nonprofits, as well as individuals, can further accelerate progress toward providing clean technologies by working with policymakers to support and pass regulations that promote equitable access. Many of the solutions above were designed and implemented due to some regulation or combination of policies. Some examples include: AB-693: Requires at least 10% of funds of the California Solar Initiative be implemented for clean energy and energy efficiency projects for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program. This bill created extra rebates for installing solar projects in affordable multifamily housing, which were snatched up in just a few months, proving the market demand for solar in multifamily housing. AB-1550: Requires that at least 35% of the funds from California’sgreenhouse gas emission reduction programsbenefit disadvantaged communities (DACs). As of May 2018, money from this pot of funding has gone toward 68,000 projects installing efficiency measures in homes, 2,600+ affordable housing units under contract, 180,000+ rebates issued for zero-emission and plug-in hybrid vehicles,and more. AB-523: Allocates 25% of the California Energy Commission’s Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) funds for projects that benefit DACs and another 10% for projects that benefit low-income communities. The EPIC program supports renewable energy research, development, and demonstration programs in California. The EPIC program has contributed significantly to California’s energy innovation ecosystem and provides around $162 million annually for projects to advance new technologies that will benefit Californians. SB 350: Declared that there is insufficient information to fully realize the potential of solar to serve low-income customers and that there is insufficient understanding of the barriers for low-income customers to access all forms of renewable energy. Since 2015, several of California’s agencies have created a cross-agency study on the barriers to technological adoption across clean energy and clean transportation technologies like solar, renewable energy, energy efficiency and others. Approximatelyone in five California householdslives at or below the federal poverty level — $32,000 for a family of two. Excluding this population means leaving a huge market behind that is key to achieving a 100% clean energy future. None of the above solutions alone will get California to a clean and equitable future. Progress requires a community of supporters, businesses, non-profits, and government organizations building a system of intertwined and coordinated resources.

https://medium.com/@mayank.agrawal84/spiritual-technology-ecac7dbbe1b?source=tag_archive---------71-----------------------,Spiritual Technology — A white paper,Written byMayank Agrawal,"Mayank Agrawal Follow -- Listen Share Introduction Delve into the best of 5000 year old, ‘spiritual technology’ based on unparalleled wisdom of authenticyogapractices and scriptures. Understand it’s practical relevance today and find solutions for our biggest problems in the modern world. While living in this glamorous material world, we remain fascinated and frustrated at the same time. Therefore, its important for us to be able to open a spiritual window to rejuvenate with fresh air of transcendental bliss. The intended goal is to describe this window, which is covered by drapes of ignorance and conditioning, these drapes can be opened by process of Yoga and then light of transcendental knowledge and spiritual bliss shines through. The ‘spiritual technology’ was at it’s peak few thousand years back. It was highly developed and prevalent in practice. It was called ‘Yoga’ because it culminated the entire lifestyle of an Vedic society. Yoga means union of everything. Hence Yoga is the process, which defines and inculcates, every action a person (a Yogi) performs both individually and collectively as a member of an elite Yogic society. Using this spiritual technology humans had created a pristine civilization which lived in complete harmony with nature. Everyone had abundance of satisfaction and happiness. The technology in itself was sufficient in providing a long fulfilling and healthy life. It tapped into fulfilling the real needs of all living beings. It extracted from human beings their inherent sense of goodness and morality, via practical actions that suited the circumstances of their particular time and place. History and Background Like many great modern nations or civilizations of the past were formed under the leadership of great men. For example, United States of America became a great a nation after a few learned, highly intellectual and good meaning men came together and signed the constitution of this country. Similarly, in India many thousand of years back, a great culture based on solely around spirituality was developed. It was built with the instructions and examples of great Saints who were extreme Yogis in their own right. They were also learned, intelligent and highly self realized. The key differentiating factor of these magnificent Saints, was that they were very advanced in spiritual knowledge. There were always the others, who were Yogis and had done severe austerities to attain esoteric mystic powers. But the Saints were not interested in mystic powers. They were aware of the absolute truth and principles of eternal religion. They were brought up in an environment where they went through the Yogic practices of meditation and scriptural studies, while maintaining a very simple and sober lifestyle. Hence they had developed the knowledge and determination to do the right thing. They could then also concentrate on the right thing for many long hours without flickering. They had developed the right desire from within their heart and were only eager for welfare of all living entities. Above all they knew who the Supreme God is and how to work in harmony with his plans. With these qualifications these Saints developed Yogic processes for different classes of people to achieve perfection. And the entire society including the ruling class functioned under the direct guidance of the Saints. Hence, everyone was happy and satisfied. The general people were very active while performing their prescribed duties but they were never anxious. They never lamented nor worried about success or failure. The basic tenant of how this is possible can be understood, by understanding the desires of all living beings. At a very basic level, we have five ‘senses organs’ (eyes, nose, mouth, ears and sense of touch), and the there are unlimited ‘sense objects’ (like delicious food, fragrances, music, movies, sports, clubs, intercourse etc) that we enjoy via our sense organs. Mind is actually considered the sixth sense organ and with sense objects like thoughts, feelings, ideas, knowledge, philosophy, humor, sense of goodness etc. Ultimately, everyone wants to be happy and enjoy, this tendency is inherent in our nature. And we derive happiness while enjoying one or more sense objects perceiving them through our senses and finally enjoying them in our mind and intelligence. This process of happiness is called ‘sense gratification’. Happiness or pleasure derived through sense gratification is aways very temporary. A lot of hard labour is also needed to enjoy these fleeting pleasures. A real life situation everyone can relate to, is the family time or gathering with friends that we set aside to be happy with them. If the plans and activities in such family gatherings or outing with friends or just vacations are carefully scrutinized. One can see that they all revolve around different activities of sense gratification. To list a few common ones; dinner plans, intoxication, gossiping, intellectual yet non-sensical discussions, watching movies and late night drama activities. We often allow ourselves some extra freedom in such occasions and often cross self set limits on enjoying one or the other sense gratification. The Saints and people in general of the Vedic civilization understood this concept really well. They knew that such temporary happiness is useless. They understood that sense gratification is only source of anxiety and distraction from the real purpose of life. The Vedic knowledge clearly declares that this material world (even though very real), is temporary and a place full of miseries. It is impossible to be find true uninterrupted happiness and state of bliss in this material world. Whatever pleasures we find will always be short lived. Fortunately, the Vedic knowledge also explains what is true happiness and the different process (Yogic paths) to achieve them. And ultimately how to achieve the real goal of human life. This process is called as ‘Self Realization’. Hence, knowing both; firstly the fallacies of the material world which dishes out many sense objects for sense gratification to keep us falsely engaged; and second the process (spiritual technology) of achieving true happiness; the Vedic civilization was established. This enabled them to collectively achieve the real purpose of human life. This pristine spiritual knowledge (technology) via revered ancient scriptures and via some extremely potent Yogic practices are still very well preserved. But they are generally hidden under the sloth of modern materialism and various variety of crap. Yet, for those who by good fortune or karma, find authentic Yogic practices find them extremely profound. And hence such intelligent people across the world, are immersing their lives in spirituality (Yoga) and deriving huge benefits. There are numerous practical applications of spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes for this day and age. The Supreme God and his Creations Its very important to talk about the concept of God in the very beginning. It is firmly believed just like how you might believe in gravity, that the Vedic Spiritual Knowledge has directly disseminated from God. There is one Supreme God who is the Creator, Maintainer and Destroyer of this Universe and of all living entities. All living beings are his fragmental parts and he is the best well wisher and benefactor of everyone. Like, every big successful company has one awesome CEO who calls the shots, but there are other leaders like department heads, presidents, directors, managers etc. These other leaders are working very hard and making critical decisions and executing the overall strategy made by the CEO for success of the company. Ultimately, the company was founded by the CEO, he makes the rules and he is the one running the company. Similarly, there is one CEO, of this universe and of all other universes and he is the Supreme God. There are other Demigods who are responsible for different departments of this universe. They are opulent and powerful, and can also bestow upon living beings a lot of material benefits. But they are also ‘created’ by the ‘creator’ the Supreme God. And their lifespan is also temporary like other living beings. Hence, one should not confuse the identity of the one and only Supreme God because of multitude of many religions and other Demigods. In India, there so many celebrated and worshipped, so-called God and Goddesses and millions of temples with many deities. Hence, there are many different faiths and religious institutions, within the Hindu religion itself. This is because of two main reasons. Firstly, a big percentage of the population(almost everyone), have not read and/or understood the Vedic Literature and hence they believe what they have learned from local culture and events growing up. Ultimately, basing their beliefs on their own mental speculation. Secondly, it’s a fact that the Demigods can and do fulfill the mundane material desires of their devotees when they are pleased, that too quickly. Thus affirming the faith of their devotees further. But the Demigods are subsidiary of Supreme God and work under his direction. The Demigods are masters of their own domain, but they are unable to bestow the ‘highest benediction’ possible for a living being. Whereas, the Supreme God is the most powerful and benevolent and can fulfill all desires of his devotees including the highest possible destination. The Demigods and the universes (including all the living beings) that they help maintain are ultimately annihilated at the end of the current cycle. They merge back into the creator, the Supreme God and hence they are all temporary. They are manifested again at the beginning of the next cycle, but the Supreme God remains unaffected, unchanged and eternal. Well what’s the highest possible benediction and how is it better or different from all the success, riches, pleasures and comforts that this material world has on offer. One might think, the highest benediction is, to go heaven, which is perceived as a super awesome and auspicious place with no misery and full of heavenly enjoyment. Heavens are real and can be obtained but they are certainly not the highest benediction. Similarly, obtaining what this material world is offering, is possible for one who endeavors very hard and is serious about his desires. Based on their sacrifices and hard work the Demigods bestow these offerings more of as a matter of universal law, than mercy. The Demigods get pleased by sincere prayers and efforts of their devotees. Therefore, even sinful and wicked people can temporarily enjoy this material world, sometimes to a great extent. But these material riches are always accompanied by anxiety, fear and misery. Life here is a see-saw of oscillating happiness and sadness, just like the eternal cycle of summer and winter seasons. Hence, the highest benediction is beyond the best riches of this material world and it is beyond the wondrous promises of heaven. It is the final destination of all living beings, it is full of sublime knowledge and bliss and it is permanent. It’s completely free from dualities (pleasure and pain) of the material world. It’s full with transcendental emotions and complete understanding of the Supreme God and our own Self. This is the ultimate goal of all spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes. The key point here is, we are all brothers and sisters having the same great grand father, who is the creator of all living beings. Like, Sun bestows its rays and warmth on everyone equally. Similarly, living entities are like the effulgent rays, emanating from the creator, the Supreme God. As he is the Supreme, he is known by many names (or religions), but the creator is one, viz., the Supreme God is one and eternal. There is no capitalism in the divine factory where living beings are produced, there is indeed monopoly and only one Supreme God is directly and indirectly, manufacturing a very wide variety of living beings and material worlds. Basic Tenants of the Absolute Truth Lets try to fit together a coherent framework, using which we can begin, to delve into the core principles of this ancient wisdom. These can be thought of as pillars and beams supporting, this most gigantic and magnificent building of Vedic knowledge. The basic tenants are enumerated, as we have an inherent need to sort and count. First tenant forms the basis and demarcates the two worlds; material and spiritual. Tenant two through six, explain the material world and our connection with it. The final tenants seven through eleven explain the spiritual world. The goal here is to introduce these concepts and get an understanding of the big picture. These will certainly get you thinking. On the other hand, for sake of conciseness some concepts are not be explained in detail. These tenants are spokes of the wheel of the Absolute Truth, the central part of the wheel, along with the whole wheel itself would get revealed in thorough reading of these concepts. 1>>The world and everything in it can be divided into two broad categories; spiritual and material. The world that we know and experience everyday is the material world. The material world is endless and full of alluring temptations. Material world keep us engaged one way or other. The spiritual world on the other hand is well hidden, it cannot be perceived by mundane senses and intelligence. The spiritual world is eternal, blissful and our original nature and source. And now that we are somehow or the other in the material world. We must use this life to prepare for going back to the spiritual world. 2>>Our body, as we know it, is temporary. This body is a machine, which is housing the Eternal Soul (the real us) for brief time period. At the time of death the Soul transmigrates from current body to the next body. As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. (Bhagavad Gita 2.13) Most of us have taken thousands of births in various species of life and on various planets before earning the great gift of Human Life on Earth. If we compare humans with other animals, its easy to see that animals also eat, sleep, have children, defend themselves and sometimes enjoy their lives. But only in the human body we been give the faculty to inquire about the absolute truth via our broad intelligence(big brain) and seven spiritual energy sectors (chakras) in our spine. Therefore, humans are very curious by nature and we want to find out all the secrets of this universe. This is why human life is a great gift because it gives us a chance to know the absolute truth. 3>>Our present body and situation is a direct consequence of our past karma(activities) and desires in this life and previous lifetimes. The laws of this universe are always enacted without failure and hence every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This world is perfect in executing it’s universal laws. Gravity does not have a blackout. The Sun, everyday rises and sets on time, without delay. Hence, the conditioning, restrictions and misery in this temporary body, continues forever, unless one is liberated. 4>>Its very challenging to be able to see things as they really are. This because we are under a strong entanglement of illusion (called maya). The starting point of this illusion is our bodily concept of life, where we consider our body and everything connected with this body (like family, religion, gender, state, nation etc.) as our own. And everything else as separate (or as others). 5>>It is not only very difficult to be happy for a short time in this world. But it’s impossible, to sustain any kind of happiness permanently and to avoid misery in this world. Hence, by any amount of hard work or extreme endeavors, it is impossible to reach a state of complete happiness or satisfaction. 6>>The material world and living entities within it are controlled by external energy of the Supreme God. This external energy (also calledMaya), is the bewildering agency, which keeps us engaged in the material world. The external energy conducts itself via three modes of material nature calledgunas,viz.goodness (sattva), passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas). All moving and non-moving things having varying degrees of these modes. And that is how they are being conditioned. 7>>There is one Supreme God. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes. (Brahma Samhita 5.1) 8>>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time Supreme Godhead descends himself (incarnates among living beings residing on material planets).(Bhagavad Gita 4.7) Supreme God declares that — To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.(Bhagavad Gita 4.8) 9>>Depending upon the time and situation, the Supreme God, tunes his incarnation (or avatar) to deliver perfectly, the living beings (who are willing to hear his message) of all miseries and misfortune. This tuning means, that the God does not have to descend on our planet with his full entourage of powers, as only a portion of his powers are sufficient in most millenniums. This means, a plenary portion of Supreme God, takes form of a divine being and lives among the people. 10>>The incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water.(Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.26) Over the millenniums, many incarnations of Supreme Godhead have appeared on Earth and hence he is known by many names and forms. These are names and forms (variety of religions) of the plenary portions of God and all of them are bonafide and auspicious. Among many, the couple of principle names of the Supreme God are Krishna and Govinda. All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.(Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.28) 11>>The wonderful, liberating and impossible activities performed by God when he descends on our planet. Not only relieve the burden of evil from the Earth. But also helps man to understand what lies beyond this material world and to believe in transcendental spiritual nature of the world and it’s limitless possibilities. Other than Lord’s personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul, He knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that affects Him, not even the results of fruitive karmic activities (pious or sinful).(Srimad Bhagavatam 9.24.28) God when he descends on Earth, does not take up a normal material body made of flesh, blood and bones. He is not bounded by laws of material nature. Rather his body is spiritual (or transcendental). Supreme God is cause of all causes, if his transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature (gunas), one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by his presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Supreme God’s Lordship, who is the controller of material nature. His transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of his transcendental form.(Srimad Bhagavatam 10.2.35) Supreme God is cause of all causes, if his transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature (gunas), one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by his presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Supreme God’s Lordship, who is the controller of material nature. His transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of his transcendental form.(Srimad Bhagavatam 10.2.35) These eleven tenants will help in realizing the journey one can take from the mundane and temporary materialism to pure bliss and illumination of spirituality. Utmost Relevance of Spiritual Technology Today In this age most of us feel, the balance of our lives is slightly (or a lot) tipped in the wrong direction. Hence, even fortunate people with health and wealth are meandering around looking for happiness. All they find are, temporary pleasures which are directly or indirectly related to sense gratification. Absence of miseries is falsely considered as happiness. We also develop a deep rooted attachment with people and objects through which we get these temporary pleasures. Attachment also fosters a strong defense mechanism, which totally disregards any idea that suggests that the objects of our attachment may not be worth it (or there could be something much more worthwhile than we have been running after). This helps us to agree, that even amidst the many riches of material comforts and available pleasure or happiness options, there hardly any hope for permanent happiness and sense of complete satisfaction. By nature everyone is ultimately looking for happiness but they are not finding it to their heart’s satisfaction. The reason for this is that we have completely lost touch with our spiritual nature and our soul. The culture and knowledge of spiritual technology which could enable us to reenter the realm of spirituality, has been discarded, degraded and manipulated. There is unbounded happiness viable for anyone who taps into spirituality with sincere efforts. But this is lost on us. This is not only an individual’s self help problem. Rather, it is much more grave and encompassing, as our society, world governments and schools, research and science and our fantasies for future are completely relying on material technology and only looking for material temporary happiness. There is no inclusion of spirituality in any real plan that people actually would execute. Spirituality is often clubbed into either religion or religious sentiment, sense of goodness (charity or philanthropy) or some form physical circus Yoga (or mediation). Religions and religious practices have been marginalized, not paid attention to and in general people have no proper understanding of even their own religion. To conclude, in material world there is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Since our education, society, nation or current fashion discards spirituality and there is no hope of finding true happiness with materialism, we are actually doomed in this lifetime. The problem is at a much macro level as we are collectively churning away at materialism with full energy and focus. The best scientists and biggest companies of the world are working to find new sophisticated ways of bringing out more and more of material comfort, pleasure, ease of life and longevity of human life. Hence, the best of the world are only engaged materially. At best, they are engaged in philanthropic activities, which only help to solve relatively smaller problems and their solutions only work for sometime. To date, there is not even a single working solution for grave world problems like mass violence, mass hunger or global warming. Take a moment, and think about this, nobody thus far has a working solution, among; top notch scientific research, engineering endeavors, Nobel prize winners or best philosophers or economists or great governments. The best solutions we have are helping us to just survive and delay the inevitable. They provide a cushion or decrease the amount of misery. They materially enrich and empower a few more humans every year. They provide new profound ways for sense gratification for temporary pleasures. They are nice. But, they aren’t permanently solving any grave world problem by its root cause. They are not providing us with a nurturing society full of happiness and free from all fear. They are not taking us where we need to go. Herein lies the utmost importance of spiritual technology. It will help us open drapes of ignorance and help us experience the missing spiritual bliss which is mind-bogglingly awesome. It can help teach the society as whole on how to live in harmony with nature and with all living beings. It shows the path of how not put our self interest at the center of our lives but how to keep the Supreme God at the center and with that have compassion for all living beings. It is possible to lead a full meaningful and blissful life in this way. Spirituality is the only hope to achieve the real goal of human life. The ultimate possibilities of spirituality attained via appropriate Yoga practice(spiritual technology), is best summarized in four verses ofBhagavad Gita: “In the stage of perfection called trance, or samādhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of Yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.”(Bhagavad Gita 6.20–23) As per this description, before we can obtain “boundless transcendental happiness” there are two difficult to overcome prerequisites. Firstly, we must be able to restrain the mind completely from material mental activities. Along the same lines, the reveredYoga Sutrasgives a very brief definition of Yoga —“Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness”(Yoga Sutras 1.2). This helps to bring the mind in a pure state of consciousness. Secondly, using this purified mind we must be able to see the Self. In simple terms this means having the awareness that we are actually not this body or mind, but we are the eternal blissful soul. The soul is currently under the covering of this gross body that see and the subtle body made of mind, intelligence and false ego. At the time of death in the present body the soul will transmigrate to another body. The soul is always accompanied in all our (and that of others) past, present and future bodies by the supersoul which is a feature of Supreme personality of Godhead. The supersoul is our best well wisher, and divine portion of God himself. To perceive the soul, the supersoul and the knowledge of soul’s subordinate but divine connection with supersoul and Supreme God is the ability to see the Self. This certainly looks like a pretty tall order. This is similar to a child aspiring to become a neurosurgeon would see the process of actually becoming one as daunting. But, if the child sincerely works with determination through the long arduous process of the medical education (that too neurological), he can certainly become a neurosurgeon. Hence, in Yoga or spirituality as well, one just has to follow the bona-fide process with sincere hard work and determination. And then, all the limitless possibilities of spirituality and reaching the perfect state of trance, become achievable. A well known saying goes — “the change begins with us”. It’s actually very true. Each responsible person must endeavor to become perfect by applying spiritual technology. And the more such people we have in the world the more real positive impact they can make towards emphatically solving all the big problems of the world from their root cause. Breakdown of Spiritual Technology (what is it?) One easy way to understand any technology, is to list down ‘practical components’ compromising the technology. To further the understanding, one then can delve into the ‘interaction between components’ and ‘how they jell together’ to deliver the technology. For example lets look at the automobile manufacturing technology which has been around for 150 years, its pretty mature and advanced. Everyone can relate to cars including children. Most of us can explain (in varying degrees of detail) how they are made and delivered to us? This is my take on it. This technology consists of these practical components; graphical car design, concept car design testing, acquiring of raw material or smaller parts, factory with assembly line to put it all together and finally transportation to send it out to world markets. Its intuitive to visualize how these components interact together and ultimately keep producing and distributing thousands of cars. Repeating this exercise for spiritual technology, here is the list of its practical components: Spiritual practitioners (Yogis) Unadulterated spiritual knowledge (revered ancient scriptures like Bhagavad Gita) Bona-fide human culture and civilization (based on Yogic ideas and principles) Qualified spiritual master (Guru) Pristine Yoga processes (spiritual practices) Unbounded spiritual bliss (and transcendental emotions) The Supreme God (the Goal) These seven components and their interactions, constitute the spiritual technology. Among these, the Supreme God is eternal and ever present. Supreme God is the creator and source of the remaining six components. These spiritual components are the supreme mercy of God and created by him to help the conditioned and suffering living beings to move from material world to spiritual world, in order to experience complete uninterrupted bliss. Spiritual knowledge explains in detail all the components of spiritual technology and how it works. Spirituality gets a great foundation, when there exists a human civilization which is based on spiritual principles. The great Indian civilization that has existed from thousands of years and has always fostered spirituality over material development, is therefore the world headquarters of spirituality(or Yoga). This civilization then produces great spiritual teachers(guru), who are well versed in the science of spirituality and can teach it to aspiring and deserving practitioners, the Yogis. The spiritual master, is a master of one or more Yoga processes and is himself a devout practitioner and he never wavers from spiritual principles. He teaches the Yoga process to his disciples based upon the exact spiritual knowledge he had received from his own spiritual master and by reading revered scriptures under his guidance. The disciples gradually develop into budding Yoga practitioners, become well versed with spiritual knowledge and start tapping into the unbounded spiritual bliss. At this stage they start developing an understanding of Supreme God, his creations, the material illusion and real goal of human life. Slowly, the seed of love for Supreme God germinates and they start experiencing transcendental emotions. Ultimately, steadfast and fully determined Yogis achieve the supreme destination which is the eternal spiritual abode of Supreme God. Yogis who remain unsuccessful in achieving this highest goal are born again in material world, but are well equipped to continue on their spiritual journey. Taking a more broader look and going back to history, its clear that this whole world is working based on spiritual technology. InBhagavad Gitawhile describing the science of Yoga(spiritual technology) —“The Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, said: I instructed this imperishable science of Yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku”(verse 4.1). This is a clear indication that Sun, was instructed in the science of Yoga at the beginning of creation. And hence Sun is a perfect Yogi. Sun is never even a microsecond late in rising or setting, it never falls short of changing seasons and providing just the right amount of energy for sustenance of life on Earth. This spiritual technology was then also taught to the first kings and progenitors in disciplic succession. And hence it is also the basis of human civilization. The basis of this ‘science of Yoga’ or ‘spiritual technology’ is the transcendental knowledge derived from the great Vedic scriptures perfectly preserved from past more than 5000 years. This knowledge is best described in as — “Transcendental knowledge in relation with the Supreme God is knowledge resulting in the complete suspension of the waves and whirlpools of the material modes. Such knowledge is self-satisfying due to its being free from material attachment, and being transcendental it is approved by authorities. Who could fail to be attracted?”(Srimad Bhagavatam 2.3.12) To further substantiate the understanding of this knowledge we look at three types of knowledge as described inBhagavad Gita(verses 18.20–22). These are based on the three modes of material nature and the best form of knowledge is in mode of goodness and and then it degrades for the other two modes (passion is better than ignorance). Knowledge in mode of Goodness (sattva) — That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities, though they are divided into innumerable forms, you should understand to be in the mode of goodness. Knowledge in mode of Passion (rajas) — That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion. Knowledge in mode of Ignorance/Darkness (tamas) — And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in the mode of darkness. Ultimately, transcendental knowledge is even beyond the mode of goodness and hence called transcendental. This knowledge is the gateway to achieve ultimate perfection (full knowledge, full bliss) in human life. This breakdown of spiritual technology, would have hopefully helped in building a 10,000 feet picture. And makes the reader excited starting his or her own transcendental journey towards spirituality.",Mayank Agrawal,https://medium.com/@mayank.agrawal84?source=post_page---byline--ecac7dbbe1b---------------------------------------,0,22 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg,2020-09-19T21:48:05.066Z,Medium
https://medium.com/neweconolab/ecc-elliptic-curve-encryption-feb48340f31f?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,ECC elliptic curve encryption,Published inNewEconoLabs,"robbie wang Follow NewEconoLabs -- Listen Share This article written by Li Jianying explains the ECC eclliptic curve encryption in a simple way. Regarding RSA’s idea of ​public-private key encryption, I thought I knew it well and I was skillful of it. Of course, RSA is not used much now, but the most famous crypto that’s based on the ECC curve for signature verification is Bitcoin. But the other day when I talked to others about the code, I was asked why ECC can be used for the signature verification, I found that I can’t give a clear explanation of it. So I did some homework to make this issue clear. First of all, we skip the topic of what ECC curve is. because I feel that it is not very helpful to understand its logic. It is better to black box it. Because we are coders, there are “types” that are very clear, and you don’t have to be afraid at all. Just say the principle, non-pseudo code, for example, I will not say the curve degree as skipping it does not affect understanding the principle. The core principle of ECC curve encryption As we discuss in the article, we assume all points are on the same curve, on which the points support a multiplication operation. Let Q be a point on the curve If the point R = Q * Q, it can also be recorded as R = 2.Q If the point R = Q * Q * Q, it can be recorded as R = 3.Q If the point R = Q * Q * … * Q, a total of n Q, it can be recorded as R = n. Q Then here comes the principle. It is easy to find R if n and Q are given. If R and Qare given, it is very difficult to find n. On this principle, then everything else is proved. Public and private keys Let’s review the principle first Let Q be a point on the curve and k be an integer Let point K = k.Q, if k and Q are given, it is easy to find K If K and Q are given, it is difficult to find k Let me show you in another way. Let G be a point on the curve and k be the private key. Let the public key K=k.G, if the private key and G are given, it is easy to find the public key. If a public key and G are given, it is difficult to find the private key. Is it a bit interesting? From here we can also see that the private key of ECC is an integer, a very large integer, not to mention Int64. In the commonly used ECC algorithm, the private key is a 256-bit integer. The ECC public key is a point, although they are usually seen as either strings or bytearray, but the private key is an integer and the public key is a point (two-dimensional coordinate). There are many applications for the ECC curve. The most common ones are encryption and decryption as well as signature verification. Encryption principle Encryption steps First set K=k.G, (public key = agreed point G to the power of private key). 1. To pass the data m, first encode it as a coordinate point M (how to encode it is your thing, such as a string, you bytes it first, then turn into a large integer, and make it as the x in the coordinate. It’s purely an example. 2. The entire random integer r 3. Calculate the point C1 = M+r.K It must be a little confusing here. There is a dot addition, and r.K, r.K is r Ks multiplied, and K is the public key. That is, point C1 is equal to r public keys multiplicated plus coordinate point M 4. Calculate the point C2 = r.G G is the agreed point on the curve, that is k=k.G (public key = agreed point G to the power of factorial private key), r is the previous random integer After the encryption is completed, it can be seen that the encryption requires a public key, and the encryption encrypts the coordinate point M into two coordinate points of C1 C2. The encryptor only needs to send C1 C2 to the other party. Decryption steps 1. From C1=M+r.K, we can know M = C1-r.K 2. Substituting K into the above formula by K=k.G (public key = private key) M=C1-r.k.G 3. Bring C2=r.G into the above equation, you can get M=C1-k.(r.G)=C1-k.C2 4. According to the conclusions derived above, M=C1-k.C2, the decrypter can calculate the encrypted coordinate point M according to the received C1, C2 and its own private key. Principle of signature verification Signature step First set K=k.G, (public key = agreed-point G to the power of factorial private key), set the signature data to m, and use the private key for signature. 1. Process the data that are to be signed: e=hash(m), e is a huge integer. The Hash algorithm does not need to be explained. m is mandatory. The ECSDA implementation also puts a coordinate into the hash to calculate the principle. I will not substitute for them, just say e 2. The entire random integer r 3. Calculate s=r-e*k. This expression is purely an integer operation. The result s is of course an integer. The s= random number minus the hash* private key. Signature completed Usually, signature (signdata) refers to two integers, s and r. The signer sends s, r, and public key K. If you want to sign the data m, anyone can check it. Verification steps, public key is used for signature verification 1. Process the data that are to be signed e=hash(m) 2. Calculate the point V1=r.G (that is, the point of the public key, the G to the power of factorial random number r) 3. Calculate the point V2=s.G+e.K (point G to the power of factorial signature data s plus factorial public key) 4. If V1=V2, the verification is successful, then prove 5. If the data is correct, then s = r-e*k is established. 6. Now set s=r-e*k, V2=s.G+e.K to expand s to V2=(r-e*k).G+e.K 7. V2 = r.G-e.k.G+e.K 8. Since K=k.G, substituting the above formula, you can get V2 = r.G — e.(k.G)+e.K = r.G -e.K+e.K 9. The above formula cancels e.K and gets V2=r.G. It can be seen that when s=r-e*k, V2=r.G=V1 10. Conversely, when V1=V2, s=r-e*k is true then the data is correct.",robbie wang,https://medium.com/@WangRobbie?source=post_page---byline--feb48340f31f---------------------------------------,41,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*uMQfKpJaxSymP0MAT6cssw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*uMQfKpJaxSymP0MAT6cssw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*uMQfKpJaxSymP0MAT6cssw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg,2019-01-03T02:14:54.044Z,Medium
https://medium.com/screenspace-digital-signage-blog/guide-to-digital-signage-6fe27af82aa9?source=tag_archive---------125-----------------------,A Simple Guide to Digital Signage,Published inScreenspace,"Vanessa Bernauer Follow Screenspace -- 1 Listen Share Times Square and Piccadilly Circus have been synonymous with brightlyilluminated signs for nearly 100 years, captivating visitors with the logos andslogans of the world’s biggest brands. But, in the last few years, there has been a sea change. Fuelled by Internetconnectivity and the increasing availability of low-cost screens, Digital Signage is no longer restricted to major brands with budgets to match.So where does that leave you, and your business? If, like many, you have been watching the Digital Signage revolution from thesidelines (or maybe you have even stuck your toe in the water) — then this guide will provide you with a solid foundation so you’re ready to take the plunge. The term Digital Signage covers a confusingly broad range of technology, from electronic signs at a bus stop, right up to the huge screens you might find at a sports stadium. Ask an industry expert and he will tell you that Wow!Put simply, Digital Signage enables you to create and display any kind of content on one or more TV screens — all centrally controlled through thesoftware. There are very few types of business where you won’t find Digital Signage being effectively employed today. If there was a case for an advertising poster or an information board, there’s now a case for a digital signage screen that will do the job more effectively. Seven places you’ll find Digital Signage RetailIf you’re selling to the public, you’ll sell more with Digital Signage! Communicate special offers and promotions to your customers while they’re exactly where you want them — in your store. EventsIn an environment where messages need to be frequently updated, or intemporary locations, Digital Signage provides the flexibility you need. HealthcareIn hospitals, medical practices and dental surgeries Digital Signage is being used to provide timely information, promote awareness and greatly reduce perceived waiting times. Hotels & hospitalityNo longer the sole domain of premium establishments, Digital Signage is noweffectively employed in many hotel lobbies, conference facilities, spas, bars and restaurants. Fitness & wellbeingWith a constant roster of changing class schedules to advertise along with event promotions, club news and other health-related information, Digital Signage is very widely used CorporateDigital Signage provides a highly effective means of improving corporatecommunication and increasing motivation among business teams. EducationMuch more effective than a noticeboard, Digital Signage will inform students and parents about school events. A typical Digital Signage set-up will consist of three elements: ScreensA normal TV is enough to get started. Digital Signage playersOne per screen, usually a small box attached externally but sometimes builtinto some Smart TVs. SoftwareA Content Management System for creating your content and sending it toyour screens. Digital Signage systems range from the super-simple to the exceedinglycomplex. The one that’s right for you will depend on your needs, and yourbudget. Usually, your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the internet, either by WiFi or Ethernet, so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text,images and logos. Often you can use video and animations to make your content more appealing. In an increasingly competitive world, it’s more important than ever to make sure that you communicate effectively with your audience, whoever they are. Here’s why you can no longer ignore the power of Digital Signage as a medium for doing so: It gets resultsAll the evidence shows that Digital Signage is more effective than printed material at grabbing the attention of your audience. Furthermore, recall of Digital Signage ads is higher than almost any other kind of advertising. All this translates to more profit on your bottom line. It’s flexibleHave you ever wished you could change your printed ads at different times of the day, or make the space on the wall work harder by displaying more than one ad at a time? Digital Signage gives you the flexibility to do both at the click of a mouse. It’s better for the environmentChange your ads as often as you like without incurring any printing or delivery costs, and without generating any waste. Today’s energy-saving LED screens are extremely efficient so your running costs are low. It’s easy to get startedSwitching to Digital Signage is easy — you can even re-use your existing content! Some systems offer a range of templates to help you get started so all you need to do is edit the text and add a logo. It’s surprisingly affordableThe initial investment in Digital Signage is surprisingly low given the tumbling cost of TV screens. Prices vary widely for Digital Signage players and software but if you make sure you’re not paying for sophisticated features that you won’t necessarily need, the running costs can be very modest and will often be outweighed by the savings on printed material. Why digital signage knocks spots off old-fashioned printed signage… Usually, your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the Internet, either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet, so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text,images and logos. Often you can use video and animation effects to make your content more appealing. Some systems allow use of widgets for weather, social media and news too. Others will provide a selection of free or paid templates that give you a head-start in your content-creation. More sophisticated Digital Signage software allows the scheduling of playlists so that you can display different content at different times during the day or week. Generally speaking, the more sophisticated the feature-set you are buying, the more expensive your Digital Signage solution will be. It is remarkable how much you can do with a simple solution. Our top takeaways:Consider carefully what features you really needStart simple: you can always upgrade to a more sophisticated solution later. The cost of your Digital Signage setup will usually break down into twoelements: One-off costsYour upfront investment will generally need to cover your screens, Digital Signage players & any installation and configuration. Sometimes some of these costs are bundled into the recurring costs (see below). Recurring costsNormally you will pay a recurring cost for access to, and use of, the Digital Signage software that runs your system. Sometimes this includes the cost of the players and sometimes not — take care to compare like for like. Recurring costs can be as low as £10/month per screen or ten times that for sophisticated systems. Be sure to check the minimum contract term too, to avoid getting tied into a solution before you have properly evaluated it. When designing content for your Digital Signage, normal graphic designprinciples apply — but there are some specific principles that you should bear in mind too: 1. Address your audienceGet your message across in 2–3 seconds, unless it’s a waiting or queuingenvironment in which case you can provide more depth. 2. Make it dynamicAds featuring video or animation content perform considerably better thanstatic ads — but be careful not to overdo it! 3. Keep it freshThe beauty of digital signage is the ease with which it can be updated. Makesure you keep your content fresh and varied.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-dance-between-certifications-and-self-learning-as-a-technologist-279975c8630b?source=tag_archive---------72-----------------------,The Dance Between Certifications and Self-Learning as a Technologist,Published inDataDrivenInvestor,"Rich Stewart Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share I have chosen to own my certifications as a Technologist by paying for every one of them that mattered to me. I never waited for or had a sense of entitlement that my employer should pay for them. Over the past 16 years I have earned an alphabet soup of certifications including PMP, ITIL, CSM, CSPO, CSP, and SPC. Only the ITIL foundation certification was sponsored by a former employer, as they were offering it to all of their IT staff. At specific strategic points in my career I have leveraged my certifications to land key jobs that furthered my career. So, I certainly understand that certifications can help a candidate land a job. With so many candidates applying for positions, often a specific certification on a resume can make the difference between an application being considered or rejected based on specific filters. This can be especially important in certain technology areas where a very challenging certification demonstrates extensive knowledge and experience. Some great examples include the CISSP security certification and the CBAP certification for business analysts. While certifications can play a role in getting considered for a job, many of them demonstrate little more than initiative. For example, consider the two first-level Agile certifications offered by Scrum Alliance: Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). The CSM is obtained by attending a two-day course (by a Certified Scrum Trainer) and then passing an easy 40-question test. The CSPO is even easier. It is obtained merely by attending a two-day course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer. Don’t get me wrong. I took both of these courses and they were valuable to me. I have used material from each course, taught by very experienced and respected trainers, in subsequent roles as an Agile practitioner. What I’m saying here is that because certifications such as these don’t require one to already be a practitioner and to demonstrate working knowledge, the value in having them on your resume is that they show you took initiative and invested in yourself. That is a positive and I’m happy to acknowledge that obtaining the CSM helped me land my first full-time Scrum Master role. Having said that, I don’t plan to renew my current certifications or pursue any new ones in the foreseeable future. Why? It’s actually pretty simple. I’ve spent the past five years working as an Agile practitioner in the role of Scrum Master and/or Agile Coach. During that time, I’ve gained a wealth of hands-on experience working with Agile teams, Product Owners, and other supporting roles. I’ve delivered extensive training (including the equivalent of the two-day CSM and CSPO courses) internally with my current company,IHS Markit. I’ve also coached many individuals and teams to help them mature in their Agile roles. In short, I’ve gained much more experience than any certification could properly express. But that’s just one of the reasons I am not pursuing more certifications. The other key reason is that I make time fordeliberate practiceevery single week. Deliberate practice refers to highly-concentrated learning, and many successful professionals claim the associated five-hour rule of concentrated learning per week is the key to their success. I am very fortunate because I have a boss who practices and fully supports the five-hour rule for his team. However, while we carve out time for deliberate practice during working hours, our passion for our profession means we also choose to do highly-concentrated learning during non-working hours. As a case in point, I’m writing most of this article on New Year’s Day 2019. And if you don’t think writing is deliberate practice, you need to give it a try. Writing is a great exercise to synthesize prior learnings and to gain new insights. Whether you choose to publish and share your writings with others is secondary. The biggest mistake a professional can make is to not invest in their continued learning. The world is changing at a dazzlingly fast pace and we all know that pace is increasing. So why would anyone choose not to invest in oneself to ensure their skills and knowledge remain current, relevant, and marketable? I can only think of three reasons. 1. A person doesn’t have enough passion for what they do to want to learn more. 2. A person feels their employer owes them the training and therefore they shouldn’t have to invest in themselves with time or money. 3. A person is performing well in their current job and is satisfied with how their career is progressing. Let’s break these down. #1. If you don’t have enough passion for continuous learning, that’s a sure sign you need to consider doing something else. Unfortunately, until you’ve actually found your passion, it’s hard to have the perspective of what it feels like to feel really passionate about something. I managed a traditional project management office for nearly five years before becoming an Agile practitioner. While I was successful, I never felt a real passion in that role. I didn’t spend hours each week building on the baseline of knowledge I gained from earning the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. If I’d have had the perspective then that I do now, I would have sought alternative career directions much sooner. #2. Entitlement is never a winning formula. Employers invest in their employees to widely varying degrees. Moreover, what employers typically do is pay for some one-time training for select employees. That’s not much better than getting another certification. The real lasting and deep learning comes from deliberate practice. You have to own the negotiation with your manager to get regular time each week for learning. If they are unwilling to do so, that tells you all you need to know about your manager and/or employer. It’s time to invest in yourself with deliberate practice on your own time to find a better manager and/or employer. #3. It’s easy to get comfortable with using specific skills, especially if your employer is happy with the job you’re doing. However, technology evolves very quickly, and chances are if you’re using the same technologies you were using five years ago, your skills are dated. One day you’re likely to wake up and find yourself marginalized at best or laid off at worst. As a technologist, never be satisfied with your level of skill and expertise with the technologies you have mastered. If I find myself interviewing for a new job someday as an Agile practitioner and am not offered the job because my certifications aren’t current, how will I respond? I will thank that prospective employer for their candor and will consider myself fortunate for dodging a bullet of joining a company with the wrong mindset. If they value a piece of paper more than demonstrable expertise and experience, they are not a company I’d want to join. Key Takeaways Leverage certifications for specific purposes to further your career at key points. Leverage your ability to reinvent yourself through deliberate practice to further your continual growth and to become a leading technology professional in your field.",Rich Stewart,https://unsplash.com/@bubo,5,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg,2019-01-04T03:13:07.966Z,Medium

Think of DPOS as a representative democracy, wherein the elected officials confirm the legitimacy of individual transactions and the overall public ledger. By the way, during crypto winters, running SBPs is a great way to make use of your VITE coins😁 Vite uses a variant of DPOS calledHierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (HDPOS). This is due to ourBlock Latticearchitecture which is a novel form ofDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG). In HDPOS, there are multiple levels of consensus: Local Consensus: Happens at the level of user accounts and smart contract accounts. Vite’s Block Lattice DAG ledger means that each user and smart contract has its own chain.Delegated Consensus Groupsare hand-picked sets of full nodes who determine the state of smart contracts.Global Consensus: Global Consensus happens at theSnapshot Chainlevel, through theSnapshot Consensus Group. The Snapshot Chain is an overall ledger of all chains at the Local Consensus level; though it does not store the whole ledger, it stores key information such as account balances and roots of Merkle Trees of smart contract states. Local Consensus: Happens at the level of user accounts and smart contract accounts. Vite’s Block Lattice DAG ledger means that each user and smart contract has its own chain.Delegated Consensus Groupsare hand-picked sets of full nodes who determine the state of smart contracts. Global Consensus: Global Consensus happens at theSnapshot Chainlevel, through theSnapshot Consensus Group. The Snapshot Chain is an overall ledger of all chains at the Local Consensus level; though it does not store the whole ledger, it stores key information such as account balances and roots of Merkle Trees of smart contract states. The relationship between Local Consensus and Global Consensus is captured in the following analogy: a company records its financial transactions (Local Consensus) and an auditor confirms that they are correct (Global Consensus). Supernodes are members of the Snapshot Consensus Group, from which the top 100 are eligible to become SBPs💪 Snapshot Block Producers (SBP)are the top 25 voting Supernodes within the Snapshot Consensus Group, who produce blocks for the Snapshot Chain. Vite invented the Snapshot Chain to mitigate well known security issues posed by DAG architecture. To become an SBP, a node must: Stake 1,000,000 VITE Run a server and have necessary skills to maintain that server Have community influence and be able to call for votes from VITE holders The top 100 SBPs with the most votes will be allowed to produce blocks and receive mining rewards. The probability for a top~25 SBP to produce a block is 23/25, and the probability for a SBP placed in the 26th~100th range to produce a block is 2/75. In total, the SBPs running over a full year will receive mining rewards worth 30 million VITE (roughly 3% of total supply). SBP rewards are divided into two categories: Block-producing rewards: 50% of SBP rewards will be distributed based on the number of blocks created by each SBP as a percentage of total number of blocks created. Staking and voting rewards: the other 50% will be distributed based on the amount staked and the amount of votes received by each SBP as a percentage of the total amount staked and the amount of votes received (by the top 100 SBPs). 1.Set up a full node.This takes 10 minutes maximum. full nodes keep the complete Vite ledger, vote for SBP’s and earn rewards unique to full nodes. Check out thefull node tutorial. 2.Set up a Supernodein order to become an SBP. Be ready to stake VITE through your wallet and start the process of getting votes! Check out theSBP tutorial. Recommended hardware requirements: SBP (Snapshot Block Producer / Supernode): 2 CPUs / 8 GB RAM Full node: 1 CPU / 4 GB RAM * Minimum of 5 Mbit/s stable internet connection is required. Take a look at ourSBP list. Many of the teams have interesting personal profiles and they’re based all over the world! Many SBPs also happen to be Vuilders.For example: VINU, Vitamin Coin, ViNo, ViCat, MakingCents, Vivafi, ViteTogether, VoltLabs. Many of them give away native coins of their project to attract votes.See this dashboardfor the APY a user earns by voting for SBPs🙌 Vite Website:https://www.vite.org/ ViteX Website:https://vitex.net/ Vite Twitter:https://twitter.com/vitelabs Vite Forum:https://forum.vite.net Telegram: English:https://t.me/vite_en Chinese:https://t.me/vite_zh Russian:https://t.me/vite_russian Japanese:https://t.me/vite_japanese Vietnamese:https://t.me/vite_vietnamese Arabic:https://t.me/vite_arabic German:https://t.me/vite_german Turkish:https://t.me/vite_turkish Filipino:https://t.me/vite_filipino Spanish:https://t.me/vitespanish Indian:https://t.me/Vite_India Korean Kakao Community:https://open.kakao.com/o/gWp9av5c Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/vitelabs/ Discord:https://discordapp.com/invite/CsVY76q Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/vitelabs/ Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/vite.labs/?hl=en YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/c/vitelabsofficialchannel",LKK153,https://medium.com/@lkk153?source=post_page---byline--a47027401cab---------------------------------------,506,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*JntVn4oj6-qLMQVnscu7Fg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*ZHJvHDQZqWJtaPH-TPGx1Q.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ZHJvHDQZqWJtaPH-TPGx1Q.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ZHJvHDQZqWJtaPH-TPGx1Q.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*JntVn4oj6-qLMQVnscu7Fg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*JntVn4oj6-qLMQVnscu7Fg.png,2023-01-03T20:55:03.420Z,Medium

In this episode, we cover: Cheryl’s background in retail marketing and innovation while you were with Clorox and The Sharper Image. How did that lead to your career in venture?On your website it says, “WE HELP ENTREPRENEURS BUILD MAGICAL COMPANIES,”… how specifically do you help? Talk to me about about the Gen-Z folks… this is part of your focus at BRV… what are the high-level characteristics of this coveted consumer segment? Are founders adjusting their approach to tech to better serve this group? How the evolution of mobile apps and real time data has influenced the health and consumer industries? You recently spoke on a panel about acquisitions… can you talk a bit about what it takes to build a company that’s well-positioned for an exit? Talk to me about Equity Summit coming up in January… what is it, what was the genesis and what are you hoping to accomplish? This year Prequin reported that BRV is one of the most consistently high performing firms in venture… I know that you’ve been at this for ten years now at Blue Run… what are some of the key factors that have led to your sustained success? I came across your recent article on succession planning and it had me a bit worried… are you planning leaving the industry anytime soon? Being an early stage investor, Cheryl takes the approach of doing a little bit of everything for her founders including the sourcing of candidates, getting their first customers, creating a pipeline for follow on rounds and guidance with product and pricing. When interacting with your founders, it is important to understand that the journey of an entrepreneur can be a lonely one therefore providing consistent communication and support on an as needed basis is key. Part of Blue Run’s strategy is maintaining a small firm along with tapping out at 7–8 boards each partner is on. This allows them to manage portfolio diversity while also giving enough time and attention to each of their startups. Gen-Z is the first “mobile native” generation and are not held captive to the large social network platforms like past generations. These characteristics open up a lot of possibilities and a possible platform disruption that will give smaller tech and mobile companies new opportunities. Elements of Gen-Z that Cheryl finds most interesting are the non social elements, specifically from a work and productivity perspective. When approaching Gen-Z, founders and startups will need to focus on user experience, such as shortening content length, rather than technology because mobile smartphones have been prevalent for many years. Cheryl believes the more advanced consumer behavior she has seen in China will be significantly comparable to that of Gen-Z. An interesting point Cheryl touches on is how pervasive mobile consumer behavior has completely changed the way people experience all walks of life, specifically Gen-Z. Today there are experiences built around being “Instagrammable” that were not present in past generations. Cheryl see’s huge opportunity focused on normalizing and tracking persistent health data in real time. For the first time with mobile, consistent sensing is available which has the potential to unlock many innovations on how we treat, diagnose and manage our health and specifically chronic diseases. The challenges Cheryl predicts for mobile healthcare are first balancing such a large market to then marry that with a scaleable business model, along with some resistance from consumers in the US being asked to pay for their healthcare. The key elements to building a company thats well positioned for an exit include…Technology, having a strong engineering team that has built a defensible and unique IP, Growth, having impressive user engagement and Optionality, executing at various levels and stages to create multiple exit options. Cheryl talks about the Equity Summit and that it’s goal was to create a an intimate forum for LP’s and female GP’s to discuss trends, investing and specifically venture as a business. The importance of building trusted relationships with not only founders but your LP’s and investors as well. Key factors that have lead to Blue Run Ventures’ sustained success include exercising constraint in regards to fund size, knowing the firms strengths and weaknesses in order to really focus on adding the most value and understanding key geographies that will implement growth. Cheryl thinks about succession planning by building a culture that utilizes the unique skills each person brings to the firm that guarantees the best decision making and execution.",Nick Moran,https://medium.com/@TheFullRatchet?source=post_page---byline--d9494ca8bb1d---------------------------------------,1,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*oNnS60ABstMZixRnApXdzA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*oNnS60ABstMZixRnApXdzA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*oNnS60ABstMZixRnApXdzA.png,2019-01-03T19:22:50.512Z,Medium

Ronit Avni,Localized Inc., Founder & CEO. Which country did you emigrate from? Canada, from Montreal. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US? Adjusting from having a recession mentality to an abundance-driven one. I left Quebec which was going through a deep recession that lasted many years and so you had to take whatever job you could find — today that is no longer the case but there were no jobs when I was growing up. In the U.S., you could be more ambitious and more creative if you set your mind to it, but it required shifting to an abundance mentality that allowed you to dream. What was your very first job? Outside of college where I had a variety of jobs, I worked at the human rights organization,WITNESS.org, because I wanted to fuse documentary filmmaking and human rights work. This was at a time when YouTube didn’t yet exist (nor did digital cameras). WITNESS was the first group to envision the ubiquitous presence of cameras, and their potential for social transformation if held by human rights defenders. Peter Gabriel, the musician, conceived of the idea while traveling to South Africa in the 1980s. I joined in 2000 and got hooked on the role that media and technology could play in effecting change. Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? (c.f. What triggered you?). It wasn’t a conscious choice at first — I would see a gap, look around to see who was filling it, and if there was someone doing so effectively in ways that interested me professionally or creatively or ethically I would join them (in the case of WITNESS, my first job), and if there wasn’t, I’d endeavor to do so directly. That happened both with my first organization, Just Vision, and again with my company, Localized. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story). With my first organization, a media/educational nonprofit, I secured a fellowship that allowed me to then slowly raise philanthropic dollars to build out our team. Our first donation was $2500 and that seemed like a lifeline then. I slept on the floor on a mattress in my office for months and gave up my bedroom to a fellow colleague while we worked on our first film. Slowly the organization built a base of supporters and grew to an international team. We produced films and a news site and grew. In the case of our new company, Localized, it has been a painstaking process of fundraising. First through professional acquaintances who know that our team is true to our word, and now from seasoned investors. It is ongoing as we are still an early-stage company with a mix of angel investors and institutional ones. My co-founder Ariadne Papagapitos and I have done some consulting on the side so we could run lean. Why do you think you have been successful? With a musician parent, you learn creative persistence in the face of financial uncertainty and develop a tolerance for risk. Perhaps some combination of stubbornness, risk tolerance, and the ability to weave between communities and cultures. What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship? Check out resources likeUnshackled Ventures. Start your company in school if you can. Secure more runway than you think you need.",Amine Rahal,https://medium.com/@aminerahal613?source=post_page---byline--e27a27d9512b---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO,2019-01-07T14:25:13.329Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@tgm/thoughts-for-2019-fd87b273d90f?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,Thoughts for 2019,Written byThomas McInerney,"Thomas McInerney Follow -- 1 Listen Share At the beginning of last year I wrote “Trends from 2017, Predictions for 2018”This year I wanted to focus on spaces and problems I’m thinking about. If you have a company addressing any of these topics or are an investor looking at these spaces please be in touch. Of course, all comments and thoughts are welcome. Tech is global— this was and continues to be true. Tech has become so significant that it now blends with national interests to such an extent that even autocrats are wary of tech companies. I’d heard a rumor that Jack Ma was forced to step down from Alibaba because he met with Trump before Xi Jinping. Whether that’s true or not it’s a sign of the times. Battles for dominance are playing out between nation states and it seems to be a two horse race between China and the US. Russia, North Korea and others have hacked many US institutions and attempted to interfere with elections. Softbank wascaught up in the Saudi MBS scandal. The EUhas been a tough regulatoron US tech companies but Europe itself isn’t competitive in technology — putting it at a significant disadvantage long term. I’ve been thinking about community a lotand how technology can really improve day to day life. What makes a great town or city? One important element is safety and security. In 2018 I experienced bike theft, package theft and identity theft. Technology like Nextdoor, Nest, Ring,Bike Index, are helpful for consumers. More controversial is the idea of asocial credit score in China. In the US, the police are over worked and prisons are over crowded. I’m open to local government using cameras and AI to stop crime (and actually deter it). If people are smashing up scooters, breaking into homes, spray painting schools, orbreaking car windowsI don’t have a lot of sympathy for them — cameras plus AI can help record, identify and catch these folks. Police should have access to world class technology tools and perhaps they’d be less prone to using force. Humans Are Underrated— I don’t see humans being replaced by robots or AI any time soon. Humans are super smart at general intelligence and their bodies are superior to any general purpose robot. But robots and AI combined with human intelligence in manufacturing or almost any other context are powerful. This is something Elon Muskwas reminded of the hard way. AI+ humans can create interesting things. What if skilled laborers working on a construction project were orchestrated, scheduled and even inspected by AI and they got to keep more of the economics (which goes to the construction management companies now)? There is currently ashortage of skilled laborin the US so look for humans to be augmented and not replaced in the short and medium term. AI can make it so humans can do more advanced work and AI can also be useful in training for new skill sets. Homelessness and drug addiction are getting worse— this is straight out of dystopian science fiction. For some, drugs can be recreational or even enlightening but for a certain percentage of people they result in devastating addiction. Opioid derivativeshave gotten crazy.New ideas for how to deal with drugs like legalization are being explored in various States which is a worthy endeavor. Homelessness (largly the result of substance abuse, mental illness and a housing crunch) is a hard problem which has plagued anddivided San Francisco. There are some interesting new companies likeWeRecover,Two Chairs, andPear Therapeuticsproviding therapy online. AI could eventually be used to provide or augment therapy in the not too distant future. Building restrictions have become onerous and the construction industry is ripe for innovation. Crypto — everything is correlatedin a bear marketI was wrong in my prediction that there would be a flight to quality in 2018. Instead the whole sector went into a bear market including leaders like BTC and ETH (Ethereum losing an order of magnitude from its highs). Some of my friends have become Bitcoin maximalist but it’s incredibly hard to make predictions in this space other than fundamentally useful technologies arebeing built and important deep research is happening. Crypto is a real innovation in computer science and mathematics but the implications are far out and hard to see. Current UX is still terrible and private key management is super difficult. Scaling is still a major challenge.Institutional money is moving inbut carefully. The free market worksin the long term but the environment and poverty are imporant externalities that aren’t solved. Those are ideally handled by well run government but we don’t have that for the most part. Not sure what the solution is — perhaps a combination of NGOs, generational values shifting or incorporating environmental costs into free market models somehow. Young people are far more attuned to the environment than the older generation and they are demanding brands represent their values. But solving problems like climate change or plastic pollution requires global cooperation and short term sacrifice which seems very difficult. I’ve invested inBird,Arcadia Power,Charm Industrial,JoyMode,GetAround,Opus 12(all helpful) and want to do more cleantech investing especially inthe waste stream. I was surprised to see the backlash against scooters, and it reminds me of thebacklash against umbrellaswhen they came to England in the 18th Century. The bar for retail is way higher.Amazon has raised the bar for what consumers demand from retail by making it so most things can be bought online effortlessly. Retail has to be better than it has ever been to compete. But paradoxically the Amazon retail stores are lackluster. Los Angeles was ground zero for scooters and I think it is ground zero for some really cool new retail experiences like thePalisades Village, theWestfield Mall at Century City, high streets like Abbot Kinney in Venice and the Arts District in downtown LA. And Japan sets the bar globally for best retail andurban planning. Sears went bankrupt in 2018 and big brands may lose ground to more boutique and local retail. The best answer for retailers may be traditional things like highly personalized service and specialization versus big box chains. There is an encouraging trend away from material goods towards experiences andLVMH bought Belmondto capitalize on that trend. Pessimism has taken overnot sure exactly why but a guess is rapid global change and perhaps over exposure to media. Human population has more than doubled from 3 billion in 1959 to approaching 8 billion people now. This means mind numbing traffic, long lines at airports, expensive housing, being a number instead of a name in your community, phone trees instead of human operators, etc. We can innovate around these problems but they present a real challenge. I’d like to see more studies on how screen time affects happiness and well being. People are losing faith in large institutions. Young people prefer socialism to capitalism. This is a troubling trend if true — few of them have actually experienced socialism and people should visit Venezuela or Cuba to see it first hand before advocating for it. Starving Venezuelans have taken toeating rabbitswhereas most Americans get to choose how they want their latte. I’m hoping voters globally aren’t seduced by wild promises from the far left or far right and start putting the ball in the middle of the fairway again. We have real problems but this is also the best time to be alive in human history for the majority of people in the world. And things are getting better every day.",Thomas McInerney,https://medium.com/@tgm?source=post_page---byline--fd87b273d90f---------------------------------------,328,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg,2019-01-03T06:25:54.505Z,Medium

Mr Yu had panel discussion about the topic of “E-commerce cross-border blockchain; Application scene iteration and upgrade” with other experts and audiences, and made in-depth analysis of the blockchain in the specific e-commerce scenarios. He believes that e-commerce can open up information flow, logistics and capital flow by implementing blockchain technology. Through the cooperation based on trust, optimize the upstream and downstream relationship of the industry chain, so that the synergy between the participants is more efficient and low-cost. For e-commerce specific how to combine with blockchain to solve the existing pain points, he had four suggestions: 1. Support different categories and formats through a multi-chain architecture; 2. Support product life cycle tracking through product traceability; 3. Support data return to users through data validation; 4. Support commercial ecological development through incentive mechanisms Community Updates “Happy New Year, No One But You” — 2019 Welcome Event In order to commemorate the meaningful 2018 and welcome the 2019 with opportunities and challenges, VNT curated the theme game “Happy New Year, No One But You”.

https://medium.com/pcmag-access/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-tribune-publishing-cyberattack-576037d34303?source=tag_archive---------126-----------------------,Everything You Need to Know About the Tribune Publishing Cyberattack,Published inPC Magazine,"PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share Printing operations at the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune, and all Tribune Publishing newspapers were disrupted over the weekend by a widespread cyberattack, reportedly traced back to the Ryuk ransomware. ByRob Marvin Over the weekend, a cyberattack disrupted print newspaper distribution across the US. TheLos Angeles Timessaid amalwareattack on Tribune Publishing’s software systems delayed weekend distribution of the newspaper and affected Tribune publications throughout the country. The print editions of theBaltimore Sun,Capital Gazette,Chicago Tribune,Hartford Courant, and a number of other Tribune-owned papers were published on Saturday without classified ads and death notices,according to the publications. The attack also affected theSan Diego Union-Tribune, theSouth Florida Sun Sentinel,and distribution ofThe New York Times and The Wall Street Journal,the West Coast editions of which are printed at the company’s LA facility. Distribution of smaller local California papers including theGlendale News PressandBurbank Leaderwas also affected. A source inside Tribune Publishing told theL.A. Timesthe company believes the attack originated outside the U.S. and was intended to disable infrastructure rather than steal information. The companysold both theL.A. TimesandSan Diego Union-Tribuneearlier this year, but the newspapers still rely on Tribune Publishing’s production platform and printing networks, the target of the cyberattack. None of the publications’ websites or online editions were affected, and the company said no subscriber personal data was compromised. The company’s official statements stopped short of providing further details about the attack, but anonymous sources told theL.A. Timesthat theRyuk ransomwaremay be a culprit. The same ransomware took down aNorth Carolina water utilityin October. Ryuk,first describedby security software provider Check Point over the summer, tends to hit high-value targets that can’t afford major downtime, demanding hefty Bitcoin ransoms.The New York Timessaid the group behind Ryuk, known as Grim Spider, has already been paid nearly 100 Bitcoin valued at more than $380,000 this month. It’s unclear whether any of that ransom came from Tribune Publishing. According toThe New York Timesreport, Tribune first noticed a malfuctioning server this past Thursday night. It appeared to be contained but then spread throughout the company’s printing software systems on Saturday, debilitating operations and stymying page transmissions to Southern California printing presses. The company was able toresume on-time deliverieson Sunday, but it said the outage and attack were yet to be completely resolved. The company said it has reported the attack to the FBI, and a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency is also investigating the situation. There has been some debate over the ransomware culprits. Check Point has linked Ryuk to North Korea’s APT Lazarus Group. Security firm CrowdStrike, on the other hand, toldThe New York Timesit believes cybercriminals in Eastern Europe were behind the attack, which may be related to the nefariousTrickBot malware. This year alone, ransomware attacks have been responsible for crippling systems including the Newark andAtlanta city governments, the Port of San Diego, and clinical lab testing company LabCorp. Those attacks are linked back to theSamSam ransomware strain, which the US government has linked to Iran. The reported Tribune Publishing ransomware attack, whether ultimately traced back to North Korea, other nation-state actors, or hacker groups, marks the first known attack on major newspaper printing operations.

https://medium.com/@queensbusinessreview1841/lambda-school-extending-the-frontier-of-online-schooling-408477d2a144?source=tag_archive---------73-----------------------,Lambda School: Extending the Frontier of Online Schooling,Written byQBR Editor-in-Chief,"QBR Editor-in-Chief Follow -- Listen Share January 1st, 2019 By: Julia Sun A Software Engineering Manager was deemed by LinkedIn to be the 2nd most promising job of 2018,having a year over year growth of 38% and a Career Advancement score of 8/10.In today’s business environment, the demand for “tech skills” is only increasing with technology playing a pivotal role in core business operations. Employers are intensifying their search for tech-enthusiasts who have built up the skills to be able to thrive in this ever-changing industry. It isn’t just the technology industry that is driving demand for those with tech skills; it is becoming a prominent trend across industries. In sales, big data analysis can produce higher quality lead generation and increased revenue. In marketing, candidates with knowledge of SEO, HTML, and CSSare more likely to stand out from the crowd. Even in the Finance industry those with knowledge of Python are more highly valued by recruiters. Experience with AI, data science talent, cybersecurity, mobile application development, programming knowledge, and coding and engineering experience are just some of thetop tech skills that have been referenced by Forbes to be in high demand for 2018. Lambda School is one online schooling platform that recognizes the demand for tech skills and is striving to be at the forefront of the investment in tech skills for future generations with its innovative pedological model. Lambda School is a 30-week program that trains people to be software engineers. The school offers two academies —Computer Science and Data Science— along with two mini boot camps forWeb Development and Machine Learning, all of which are entirely online and live. The live lectures are designed to be in small, interactive groups to make learning more engaging. Students can complete the full course in 30 weeks, with a forty-hour time commitment per week, and the Computer Science Academy offers the ability to become a part-time student and complete it in 12 months, with a 3-hour daily commitment for 4 days of the week. The school has also set up Slack, the common team collaboration tool, to make communication easier. By logging onto the platform, students can directly communicate with professors and TAs and that way, help is provided instantaneously during school hours. This complements the live lectures incredibly well and allows students to avoid the response lag that email brings. The key differentiator for Lambda school that sets it apart from the other schools in the realm of online learning? Students pay nothing up-front. Instead, once they secure a job and earn at least $50,000 per year, they pay back 17% of their annual income for the first two years, with total tuition being capped at $30,000. If for some reason, a student is unable to find a job with a salary above the set threshold, they are not required to pay anything. Students can also opt to pay a tuition of $20,000 up-front with no later income-based repayment. Lambda School is clever with this business model. They recognize that with the rise of AI and the increased presence of technology in many aspects, the job market for software engineering and data science is on the rise, fast. Companies are hungry for driven, knowledgeable, and skilled workers who have experience with back-end development, coding, and handling data and these companies are looking to hire good talent. When looking at job outlooks, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics,Software Developers have an estimated 24% growth from 2016 to 2026, which is a much faster growth rate compared to the average of around an 8% growth rate. The drop-out rate for the school is roughly 10%, which is relatively impressive considering the intense personal commitment demanded by the curriculum. Through an application process, Lambda School allows itself to be selective about the students it accepts into the program, and it has found that the key to a good student is found in their drive. The students who are consistently out-performing their peers are the hard workers who demonstrate this trait from the beginning. A look at their financial payback set-up also proves the company has clearly thought of all its potential pitfalls. 17% of 50,000, the required minimum level of annual income, is $8500 per year. The typical entry-level software engineer salary has a median pay of $64,787 CDN. In more senior positions, theBureau of Labour Statistics even reported a median pay in 2016 of $102,280. 17% of the median pay for an entry-level position is $10,996.80. It is typically difficult for an entry-level position to pay less than a $50,000 salary, which allows the school to mitigate the risk of a student not being able to pay tuition. To mitigate this tuition-default risk even further,Lambda School has established a strong employer partners network. They have over 75 industry partners who offer the school and its student’s ongoing support, as well as hiring newly-minted developers right when they’re finished the rigorous curriculum. These partners are actively looking to hire Lambda’s students specifically, and as industry partners, they’re able to give the school feedback on the curriculum and work with them on developing and changing it. This set-up means that students have a better chance of securing a reputable job following completion of the program, the companies are hiring quality talent who went through a curriculum that they approved of, and Lambda School is receiving their desired income-based compensation. It’s a win-win-win. Recently, anApprenticeship Programwas also launched. Companies commit to creating a 3 to 6 month long paid internship with the potential for a full-time hire at the end, and the school works on finding the perfect candidate for them. Both the ongoing expansion of the partners’ network and this Apprenticeship Program is a strategic move for Lambda as it plays well into the well-known knowledge of the cost of a bad hire, and the risk and anxiety that often surrounds companies when finding new, quality talent. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the cost of a bad hire is 5 times the bad hire’s annual salary. These costs not only include the costs of re-hiring and replacing the employee, but also the effect it can have on the organization, its culture, and productivity and performance as a whole. Companies, especially in a field that is as fast-paced and innovative as computing and technology, want the A-listers of the technology realm. They cannot afford to keep around second tiered individuals who drive away the superstars and influence the organizational culture. Lambda strives to deliver these A-team programmers, who were primed with 30 weeks of intense learning and training, right to the company’s front doors. Above all, what truly makes Lambda shine is its mission of “investing in human potential”. Their desire is to aide ambitious individuals in their pursuit of building a new skill set, and they set a good example of what more organizations should be investing in. Lambda’s goal, at its core, is to grant access to higher education for those who may be getting left behind for different social reasons. According to a study done by the National Association of Student Financial Aid and Administrators,low-income students cannot afford 95 percent of colleges in the United States. It is a bit of a play into the division between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’, but their aspirations to invest in the ‘have-nots’ to help them achieve higher paying jobs is admirable. Beyond solely financial reasons, Lambda is certainly very cognizant of the additional fear that many students carry with them when beginning to walk down a new path. A lot of people in Silicon Valley underestimate how big of a risk it is to go to school for four years, take out potentially crippling student loans, and hope that it all works out on the other side. Especially if an individual doesn’t know if technology engineering is the path for them, it can be a big risk with a huge opportunity cost to go to school, spend so much time building a skill set, and then end up switching careers or programs. As Lambda so accurately phrases it, with their business model, it is school investing in the students, instead of the other way around. And this is truly what the mission of many educational institutions should be. Lambda School is supporting the next generation of up and coming tech enthusiasts by feeding their interests, at a risk-free level, and allowing them to expand their skill set by providing them with not only knowledge but also tangible experience upon completion of the program. It allows these hungry, ambitious, and passionate individuals to fully immerse themselves in the curriculum and walk out with a completely new and advanced toolbox, one with which they can ideally use to create an impact with and revolutionize the technological horizon.",QBR Editor-in-Chief,https://medium.com/@queensbusinessreview1841?source=post_page---byline--408477d2a144---------------------------------------,0,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*y8s7UZFe9VtNoIysu0IJDw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*y8s7UZFe9VtNoIysu0IJDw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*y8s7UZFe9VtNoIysu0IJDw.png,2019-01-02T22:36:05.202Z,Medium
https://medium.com/trinity-protocol/channel-transaction-processing-536e704cee6f?source=tag_archive---------74-----------------------,Channel Transaction Processing,Published inTrinity Protocol,"TrinityProtocol Follow Trinity Protocol -- Listen Share The channel transaction task comes from the TP (Trinity Off-chain Protocol) message. In order to better understand the message processing flow and working mode of the task, this section starts from the basic characteristics, mutual exclusion, orderliness of state channel transactions, and creates and forms the conventions that the Trinity system needs to follow. These conventions will be a fundamental criterion for the design of the Trinity system architecture. Below are thebasic characteristicsof state channel transactions: • State channel transactions require one or several mutex to guarantee the synchronization of transactions on both sides; • A transaction with the signature by both parties is a valid transaction (VT); • The trigger condition of the on-going transaction is: the previous transaction is a valid transaction (VT); • Semi-valid transactions (SVT) require re-signature, otherwise channel transactions will be blocked; • The benchmark balance of the n transaction is the channel balance of both parties after the completion of the n-1 transaction; • The n valid transaction and the n+1 transaction are considered to be the same transaction (in the case that the network communication sequence may result in packet loss); • The latest transaction can punish all other transactions (except for the transactions to close channels fast and the previous transaction); • Channel transactions should be aggregatable (to improve the performance and throughput of channel transactions). Simple Mathematical Model of the Channel Transactions: As it is shown in the graph, only one transaction at one time will be acknowledged and performed by both peers. To guarantee the mutually exclusiveness, Trinity observe rules in the following convention: • Two parties of the channel and their respective roles：Founder Peer and Partner Peer； • One transaction has a sole identifier (denoted by nonce)； • Classify channel transactions：special transactions and general transactions； ◦ Special transactions: creating channels (nonce=1) and swift settlement of the transactions in the channel (nonce=0). ◦ General transactions: other transactions (RSMC / HTLC): nonce >= 2. • Founder peer generate a solely identifier and a serial number for every transaction. • Partner peer verify, negotiate and reset the sole identifier. During the transaction, the MCR saves transaction data from both peers into FIFO message list, and the WCR read, verify and sign the transaction before sending it out to the other peer.

(SNAP), known for their popular app Snapchat, has been plagued by difficulties. The company has shown an inability to post a profit and requires continuous financing to remain operational. Publicly traded shares have no voting rights — a serious middle finger from management. Rather than raise debt, management opts instead to dilute existing shares. Due to these key aspects, I believe SNAP has an intrinsic value at or approaching $0 and will be an excellent short play. Snap Inc, has yet to turn a quarterly profit — the stock is dogged by this fact, coupled with poor redesigns and low revenue. Stock dilution has continued to hurt current shares,30% of which are held by insidersand another34% by institutions. Furthermore, insiders have been net sellers across both 3-month and 12-month time frames, indicating a lack of confidence in stock performance. Ad revenue without serious deep data to back it, à la Facebook and Google, is not a viable plan for profitability. Despite 188 million users as of Q2 2018, SNAP has continually posted losses and frustrated both users and advertisers with ineffective application design again and again.",Harry Sauers,https://medium.com/@hsauers5?source=post_page---byline--90be2db22b36---------------------------------------,1,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KhJMAG1Gpea7_Nru9M2L2g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KhJMAG1Gpea7_Nru9M2L2g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KhJMAG1Gpea7_Nru9M2L2g.png,2019-01-08T01:56:53.943Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@josephsantos.edu/from-the-deli-to-data-science-9187f27dd096?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,From the Deli to Data Science,Written byJoseph Santos,"Joseph Santos Follow -- 1 Listen Share When you grow up you tend to think that anything is possible. When I was 4 my grandmother bought me VHS tapes of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos (dubbed in Spanish). Back then I believed him when he said “…The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.” As I grew older, however, my dreams became more like holograms, visible, yet never truly in reach. Throughout high school my grades slowly declined as I began having terrible panic attacks. I would hide my face in my books, in a primordial cycle of fight or flight with no danger present. It became exhausting and some days I opted to not go to school at all. I distanced myself from my friends and became less and less sure of whether I had a future worth pursuing. I worked in a deli and regardless of how polite or how disciplined I was, I would always be treated as almost a competent human being. I had a boss snap his fingers at me, and while most customers were a delight some customers called me boy or asked “where are youfrom?” knowing they didn’t want to know which street I lived on. My mother and father came from harsher backgrounds than me, yet they seemed to have turned out fine, My mother went from the ghettos to becoming a Navy veteran who graduated 2nd in her class in Airmen school, and my father went from the ghettos to owning his own house at 21. Me, I hadn’t even graduated college yet and couldn’t even seem to be able to go a few days without panic attacks or feelings of depression. The day my life would change was after a particularly rough attack. I was hiding under my pillow, shaking, the room moving around me. Tears rolling down my cheeks. I looked at the first texts I had sent to the woman I would later make my wife. I told her that I promised her a life of adventure, excitement, and new experiences all the time. I had let her down. But I didn’t feel my usual indifference and sadness. Instead I felt anger. Angry that I always had to decline going to parties with too many people or where there wasn’t an adequate exit strategy. Quitting sports because of dizziness. No. I would no longer run. I would spend the next week on google scholar for hours, looking at research on depression and anxiety. I scoured articles of cures and natural remedies. I began taking Omega-3–6–9 pills, creating a diet plan entirely centered around the reduction of anxiousness, cutting caffeine entirely out of my diet and finding strategies to cope with my illness. I left the trenches and ran out into the front lines. I learned about precision medicine and began reading extensively on this field called machine learning and medical imaging. As I said it in my head, “medical data science” I knew I had found my passion. As I took more of a calculated approach towards fighting depression and anxiety, I began learning how to code, and I noticed that I hadn’t had a panic attack in months. I quickly picked it up and began taking advanced maths and programming courses at my college. My first machine learning course wasAndrew NGs course on machine learningFrom there I would take everything fromCoursera,Udemy,Jeremy Howard’s fastai deep learning coursesandMIT OpenCourseWare coursesto build up the spots where I was lacking. Anything that could get me closer to my new realized dream: a world without mental illness. A smarter, data-driven world. A world without people silently waging mental wars and feeling there are no reinforcements coming. After I felt okay with my coding ability I applied to 10 jobs a week for months and went to a few hackathons. My team ended up winning 2nd place. Things were heating up. It would be after 44 jobs rejecting me with passive statements of “while you stood out, we’ve decided to go with other applicants at this time”, that I would finally get an interview with one company; An engineering insurance company. I was now a data science intern. Wow. This was not like the deli. The developers and engineers drank cocktails with the CEO while their new building addition was completed. I was surrounded by people 10 times smarter than I was yet, they all treated me so well. I felt at home. It didn’t matter where I was from or that I was an intern and not a permanent employee. Reflecting on everything, going from a deli in a small town to a data science position in a large city, I realized that the most dangerous place to be is not the streets or untraveled avenues. Those are all the resources you have. The most dangerous place is in your comfort zone. Not being challenged is worse than being the worst in your field. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly until you can achieve mastery and do it perfectly. If you don’t start, however, then you’ll never know. I also learned that depression is the largest exclusive club there is. Everyone feels like they’re the only one when in reality there are millions of people going through the same thing as you and I. There is greatness in all of us and we all have something to give; to our country, our community, and to our field. All we have to do is start and not listen to those that tell us we aren’t capable. That is the hardest part.",Joseph Santos,https://medium.com/@josephsantos.edu?source=post_page---byline--9187f27dd096---------------------------------------,11,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg,2019-07-03T02:53:29.970Z,Medium

Jeremy Nation Follow METACERT -- Listen Share Everywhere there’s a buck to me made someone is trying to cheat someone else, and while that unpleasant reality might not leave a good taste in your mouth,MetaCerthas your back, withtoolsthat will allow you to differentiate between legitimate web resources and scams. Forging into the new year, whether you’re just getting into cryptocurrency, or you’re a veteran hodler, chances are good you’ve heard about the ripoff schemes plied by malicious actors. Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene. One of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys, or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at, and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions, which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack. Another problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance, compromised Twitter accounts, sometimes even those verified by the platform itself, have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet, they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately, they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam, misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet. One hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another. Until that day comes, you can continue to rely on security tools from MetaCert. An Ecosystem Swarming With Threats After a significant mainstream boom in 2017, nearly every chat service and social media site was crawling with crypto scammers to the point where MetaCert had to take action. Shortly after MetaCert developed tools for Slack that eradicated the phishing on the platform, MetaCert CEO and Founder Paul Walsh accurately predicted that scammers would migrate to another platform; Telegram. Again, MetaCert sprung into action, and created a bot that identifies dangerous resources such as malicious URLs and cryptocurrency addresses associated with phishing campaigns. Today, MetaCert’s powerful tools allow users to easily differentiate between legitimate and dangerous resources at a glance. The Anatomy of the Scam Phishing scams today are often difficult to discern from their legitimate counterparts. In one case a user would have need a microscope to identify a tiny pixel above character to differentiate the scam site from the real one. Other times scammers use automated systems to get a green lock signifying SSL certification on their phishing site, and consumers fall for that. The truth is, without a valid verification system, it’s practically impossible to tell at a glance whether a site is safe or not until it’s too late. The Green Shield of Trust MetaCert has verified legitimate web resources with a green shield of trust, seen by subscribers to theCryptonitebrowser plugin. That means you’ll see the green shield of trust whenever you visit a verified cryptocurrency related website, social media account, wallet provider, and/or cryptocurrency exchange. In 2018 we continued to expand our database of over 10 billion classified uniform resource identifiers across over 60 categories thanks to the participation of our community and our hard working team. In 2019 we intend to expand our verification services beyond crypto to encompass sites also targeted by phishing scammers including mainstream companies, payment portals, and more. Soon the green shield of trust will also signify you’re safe when you’re buying things online, paying bills, or otherwise managing finances through online banking services, so you’ll always know you’re in the right place on the web. Remember, if the shield is black, that means the site hasn’t been verified and might not be trustworthy, so use caution. $150 Worth Of MetaCert Tokens As A Special Bonus Your subscription to Cryptonite today will get you more than a year’s worth of safety. For the first 2,000 subscribers to Cryptonite we’re offering $150 in MetaCert Tokens, to be distributed following the end of our public sale. You’ll know right away if you’re one of the first 2,000 subscribers: To subscribe to Cryptonite now,follow these instructions. Email Security MetaCert is still beta testing our email security tool that is sure to revolutionize the way you see links in your email. Many phishing emails contain links, or images with hyperlinks. MetaCert’s email security tool uses a color coded system to warn you against known threats, or potentially malicious links. Every link that appears in your email will feature a shield beside it; if the shield is green you’re safe, and if the shield is red you know it’s a phishing link. Again, if the shield is black, that means the resource hasn’t been verified, and that you should use extreme caution clicking on it. Sign up for our email security tool for iOS today, and see how we’re changing the way people see links in their email. This report was brought to you byMetaCert.

https://medium.com/buzz-words/microsoft-github-6c43621ff208?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,Microsoft + GitHub,Published inBuzzwords,"Mayank Kishore Follow Buzzwords -- Listen Share (original post date, 7/30/2018) 7.5 billion dollars. That’s the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure, GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders, but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not). GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board, Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella. This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software. But how will Nadella integrate Microsoft’s environment with GitHub? GitHub hosts over 27 million developers who depend on using GitHub’s services daily. Since these developers serve as the key market for Microsoft’s developer tools, Microsoft will be able to push its technologies to a larger market. Their goal is to be able to empower developers at“every step of the development lifecycle.”Their biggest plans come with the GitHub marketplace where Microsoft intends to utilize the marketplace in order to push all of Microsoft’s tools and services to make it available to everyone in the developer community. Finally, Microsoft is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Visual Studio Code’s environment directly into GitHub so developers can collaborate with less effort and boost overall productivity. The last bit of interesting news comes from Diane Greene, head of Google’s cloud, who mentioned,“I wouldn’t have minded buying them.”Google has two of GitHub’s largest projects, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, and are GitHub’s biggest contributor. Greene suggested that Microsoft’s bid may have been too high to prompt Google to throw its hat into the ring. She leaves off with the hope the Microsoft will keep GitHub neutral because GitHub was founded on the basis of open source. Finally, Satya Nadella’s explains the merger: “Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.” Albeit polished, his words continue to reflect Microsoft’s bright future. The deal will close later this year, with the payment being completed in stocks.

https://hpmegatrends.com/how-tech-is-transforming-healthcare-7600c73ba064?source=tag_archive---------41-----------------------,How tech is transforming healthcare,Worldwide Healthcare: A Systemic Challenge,"Andrew Bolwell Follow Megatrends by HP -- Listen Share Can you imagine a world where a tattoo on your body can track your blood sugar and heart rate? Seems a bit like an episode of Black Mirror, but according to recent tech innovations, that reality soon might not be far off. From tattooed biosensors to robot caretakers anddigital pill dispensers, there are innumerable ways that tech can transform the healthcare space. However, before we explore the ways that tech can both assist and improve healthcare, we first need to examine the current and ongoing healthcare crisis, both globally and right here in America. Sadly, the problems that started over 50 years ago are still plaguing the global healthcare system today. Worldwide Healthcare: A Systemic Challenge Globally, the healthcare industry is constantly facing challenges. Did you know that one in seven people on the planet is on-the-move? That statistic equates to abouta billionmigrating people — astaggeringnumber and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. In particular, refugees and other migrants face distinct obstacles in accessing health care, including language barriers, cultural differences, unfamiliarity with local health services, and the inability to readily access quality healthcare. Their diverse needs also present difficulty; from migrant farmworkers who have been exposed to toxic chemicals to refugees dealing with the trauma of war. The global health implications of the healthcare crisis are ever-present in today’s world. #DYK about 1billionpeople are migrating?That’s a staggeringnumber and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. #DYK about 1billionpeople are migrating?That’s a staggeringnumber and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. Additionally, the cost of healthcare both in America and worldwide has been an on-and-off concern for years. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article,health care costsin the U.S. are predicted to reach 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025. What the report failed to note was that America is now in our 50th year of the official US health care crisis — yikes! Consider this: in 1960, healthcare expenditures were$27.2 billion, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2010, U.S. taxpayers paid nearly $2.6 trillion forhealthcare services. This statistic means that in two generations, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has increased almost hundredfold. So, what’s the solution to this massive healthcare problem that has plagued the U.S. for five decades? You guessed it: tech is now a major player that has just come into the healthcare space and may change the course of history. One of the flagrantly glaring predicaments the medical industry focuses on is treating patients after they are sick. Currently, almost every preventive care option in the U.S. includes searching for an already-present disease or malady. It is also important to note that if a condition is found, it is (usually) already too late. If a doctor finds breast cancer, you already have breast cancer. If test results show you have pneumonia, you already have pneumonia. If you test positive for high blood pressure, you already have high blood pressure. The current healthcare system is designed to be reactive instead of proactive. So much money and time are being spent to treat problems that already exist instead of taking steps to make sure they don’t happen in the first place. The U.S. is at the forefront of healthcare and modern medicine, so it’s time that we take things to the next level; this is the time to shift from standardized, reactive and centralized care to personalized, preventative, decentralized, and democratized care for all U.S. citizens. The answer to facilitating this is simple, yet incredibly complex: we must integrate tech into our healthcare system. Healthcare Anytime, Anywhere Technologies such as microfluidics, haptic holography, and autonomous robotic caretakers are transforming the future of healthcare from science fiction to reality. For example, in as little as ten years,robot caretakerscould be caring for our elderly. Additionally, artificial intelligence has the potential not only to care for our elders but to do so in a way that increases their independence and reduces their social isolation. The power of technology is in its accessibility. With the implementation of tech in healthcare, we will no longer be bound by doctor wait times, geographic location, or office hours. New developments in tech will also aid in dealing with the rise of chronic disease and doctor shortfall, where key technologies will find diseases before they ever exist and help doctors complete their work faster and more efficiently. Digital pill dispensers deliver personalized medications; chatbots allow virtual medical care for routine questions and health concerns. These technologies have been created to solve for the shortcomings of our current healthcare system. Virtual Reality Healthcare Solutions Have you ever heard of a haptic hologram?Haptic holographycreates invisible three-dimensional haptic shapes in mid-air using focused ultrasound. While still in its early days, haptic holography aims to let surgeons visually explore the insides of a human body. Additionally, researchers at Bristol University are hoping that they will soon be able to exploreCT scanswith haptic feedback. This technology will then allow them to feel tumors on the CT scan. Haptic holographycreates invisible three-dimensional haptic shapes in mid-air using focused ultrasound. Haptic holographycreates invisible three-dimensional haptic shapes in mid-air using focused ultrasound. This new type of software converts existing 2D medical imaging data such as MRI and CT scans into fully interactivevirtual reality images. With the haptic hologram system, doctors can view, manipulate and dissect body parts without ever breaking the skin. This software will help doctors gather a clearer picture of the problem faster, and have a better understanding of the situation at hand for each patient. Digitization & Miniaturization of Tech in Healthcare Haptic holography is just one example of how tech and healthcare play nicely together. Another new tech development in the healthcare space is much, much smaller. Aptly named microfluidics, this new development is, essentially, an entire lab on a tiny microchip. These microchips can detect the presence of infectious diseases and offerpoint-of-care(POC) tests. These POC tests have the potential to vastly improve health care in many ways, ranging from enabling earlier detection of disease, easier health monitoring, and increased personalization, to reaching under-served and remote populations. Microfluidic technologies offerthree main advantagesto POC diagnostics; smaller sample volumes, lower test costs, and faster turn-around times. These advantages are increasingly being leveraged to develop POC devices to detect and diagnose a host of conditions, spanning from infectious diseases to cancer. Microfluidics reduce drug analysis time from days to mere minutes! This technology will aid in democratizing healthcare, providing real-time diagnostics and monitoring pre-existing conditions or overall general health. In the future, people will be able to test themselves to monitor their personal health. This is especially useful in countries where access to quality medical care is difficult or impossible. Welcome to the digital health revolution | HP® Official Site What will our future healthcare system look like? Blended Reality is a versatile concept that can be extended from the… www8.hp.com Scientists are also working to develop nanobots, which researchers are hailing as the “future of healthcare.” Thesemicroscopic robotsfitted with magnetic nanoparticles tuned to a specific field can work together to accomplish tasks within the human body. Research suggests that nanobots could be programmed to assist surgeons in complex tasks, such as passing through tiny cavities in the human body — spaces too small for even the most skilled surgeon to reach. Recent research also suggests that magnetic nanobots are also capable of transporting cells and delivering drugs to specific locations inside the body. Just like how ants stack their bodies together to reach a taller place, or how a massive flock of birds helps defend against predators, the nanobots will work together in the body to achieve their collective goal. As advances in materials and microfluidics enable the development of new and better devices, we can expect to see these new and exciting tech developments. It’s likely that we will continue to see growth in the range of POC diagnostics available, while simultaneously reducing the cost to produce them. Additionally,recent breakthroughsin 3D printing capabilities could help lead to cheaper mass-production of these incredibly useful diagnostic devices. Current 3D printers are capable of making objects of any shape, which lowers the costs of custom objects significantly. It is now possible to customize surgical-grade titanium implants with the right shape and size for each specific patient. Further,3D-printed custom drugsmay be on the horizon, which can be personalized to the patient’s specific disease or ailment and genetic makeup. From robotic caretakers that provide companionship and medication reminders to haptic holograms and microfluidics, the benefits of merging the technology and healthcare spaces are immeasurable. With these new developments, we might finally begin to resolve the healthcare crisis that’s been haunting our world for half a century. Watch this space for new and exciting (and maybe even a little provocative?) developments that occur when tech and healthcare intersect.",Andrew Bolwell,https://medium.com/@abolwell?source=post_page---byline--7600c73ba064---------------------------------------,3,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg,2019-01-14T17:27:20.186Z,Medium

Without further ado: TaskRabbit expands its reach in the UK. IKEA owned company which connects residents with local ‘taskers’ has launched insix more citiesin the UK. This more than doubles the number of cities the company serves in the England and Wales. The new areas are Brighton, Cardiff, Coventry, Liverpool & Warrington, Oxford and Reading. The company is expected to announce its expansion in Scotland in early 2019. Recession is on its way — How will the gig economy react? On one hand, the gig economy has been booming during thiseconomic expansionof nearly a decade. Investors are on a lookout for the Uber and Lyft IPO in early 2019, with Airbnb and Instacart to follow. On the other hand, it seems like we are headed towards another recession. How will the gig economy react in this mist of all this? “run for cover.” Alan Greenspan recent warning to the investors. “run for cover.” Alan Greenspan recent warning to the investors. Even though, some experts say that recession could go in favor of the gig world as more and more people will see it as a necessity to pick up gigs and make extra income. Adam Roseman, Co-founder and CEO ofSteadyhas different views. He says that the recession, which brings both layoffs and wage cuts, would increase the supply of workers even further with fewers gigs to pick up. In a nutshell, there’s no doubt a recession will leave more people looking for gig work, it could also deflate the gig economy. Feel free to read his full analysishere. America is running low on blue-collar workers The U.S. is currently dealing with a verytight labor market. And blue-collar jobs, in particular, are experiencing an acute worker shortage. Conference Board Chief Economist Gad LevanontoldYahoo Finance that there are “three big trends happening simultaneously” causing the relatively shrinking pool of workers: Demographics, education, and continued demand for services. “The baby boom generation is much larger than the generations before and after,” Levanon said of the demographic aspect. “Now is the time they are retiring in large numbers.” “The baby boom generation is much larger than the generations before and after,” Levanon said of the demographic aspect. “Now is the time they are retiring in large numbers.” In terms of education, blue-collar labor markets are tight is because more and more Americans are going to college. Since the Financial Crisis, “the share of 23- to 24-year-olds with a bachelor’s degree has been rising sharply,” the Conference Board reported. Those with a bachelor’s degree are less likely to pursue a blue-collar career. “To put it bluntly,” the Conference Board stated, “there are simply not enough people in the labor force willing to work in blue-collar jobs.” Feel free to watch the full interviewhere. :) If you would like to receive our weekly newsletter in your email, please subscribe below.",werkapp,https://medium.com/@werkapp?source=post_page---byline--4a43fa84108d---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CxWaeeghanetpZYRhpzQLw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Q_cbLjGc_PDIYJNxHxtQUQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Q_cbLjGc_PDIYJNxHxtQUQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Q_cbLjGc_PDIYJNxHxtQUQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*CxWaeeghanetpZYRhpzQLw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*CxWaeeghanetpZYRhpzQLw.png,2019-01-03T03:05:00.339Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@nathan.james/technology-is-making-us-stupid-7777ae670ee?source=tag_archive---------148-----------------------,Technology is making us stupid,Written byNathan James,"Nathan James Follow -- Listen Share The world 50 years ago compared to modern days is an entirely different atmosphere. Grandparents would read books and newspapers, all being beneficial to the to the mind. Now, people will stare at a cell phone; reading what they see on social media, becoming highly influenced by mythical statements created only to play devils advocate with whomever they please for attention. The effects of AI or technology is creating psychological disabilities beginning with millennial's and spreading throughout other generations. millennial's grew up with easy access to technology such as smartphones and mobile laptops, thus becoming part of their everyday life. That created anxiety, depression, and shortening attention spans. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts towards people. Living in a world where technology does not exist is nearly impossible. A day without an alarm clock, cell phone, or computers has become unfathomable to adolescents. Essentially, the pace of technological advances has immensely increased over the last few decades to ease our lives and provide us more opportunities. It is undeniable that technology has changed our lives, tech critics argue that the Internet and other related technological gadgets have a deleterious effect on the human brain performance . However, tech critics only see one side of technology and neglect to mention the new intelligence that technologies have brought us. Furthermore, the existence of technology has made an incredible difference in the generation we live in by transforming global development, improving people’s lives and sparking innovation. A well-known professor from California State University named Larry Rosen, has created a correlated term to use for the diagnosis he calls an iDisorder. An iDisorder is where you exhibit signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder such as OCD, narcissism, addiction or even ADHD, which are manifested through your use — or overuse — of technology. Nicholas Carr is a brilliant writer who strongly believes and has a firm vision of the internet’s neurological effect on the brain. Throughout his article, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” he feels that “the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle” due to the rise of the internet. Carr reflects on his own experience of his years spent online and blames the internet for being the reason why he tends to get “fidgety” after two or three pages. He makes a big assumption that the internet is responsible for the rest of the society’s declined critical thinking. The dynamic of the internet alone demands the technique of skimming, we are losing the ability to read deeply and, by implication, to think deeply. Adolescents whom grew up with various amounts of technology do not have the chance to develop critical thought and creativity; weakening vital skills needed to survive in the world. The way people use social media and internet is bouncing from one place to another, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on one task such as simply reading a novel. Nickolas Carr admits “I can’t read War and Peace anymore” Before technology was yet to exist, face-to-face interactions were a normal everyday encounter. Today's society there are severe cases of social anxiety. The unceasing celebration of the self — epitomized by the “selfie” photograph — has atomized and alienated the individual. Before, people would start off the day by looking at someone of importance to them such as a mother or significant other, nowadays the majority will start the off by subconsciously looking at a cellphone or some sort of gadget. Statistically, it takes approximately 21 days to create a habit. Which is silently lethal for anybody to own a mobile device. They become addicted to looking at their phone every 5 minutes, or waking up and checking social media feed, same thing for post sleeping. It has created problems in the educational system; students have been granted easy access to the internet utilities and have allowed them to easily locate, copy and paste answers into their homework assignments. The effects of exposure caused some to not be aware that it is creating reliability. Access to the internet has made plagiarism a part of several students’ academic careers, within has a contradiction, that being technology is a huge distraction from student staying focused on homework. The invention of technology main purpose was to fill void, need, or want, creating an environment of simplicity. But, as technology grew it brought with it disorders, addiction and cognitive loss. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have slowly become a faster and more convenient way of sharing news, communication with friends and relatives across the world. Although citizen journalism has now become so cheap that anyone with a smart phone can transmit news anyhow, there have been instances where people have come to know of the gruesome deaths of their relatives and friends through uncensored posts on Facebook or WhatsApp. However, social media has became quite demoralizing and exposing the world to horribleness. Exposure to these types of graphic content develops immunization to what is known to be morally incorrect. In today's time, most of the human aspects of life revolve and are controlled or affected in someway by technology. Many people would find it hard to cook without microwaves. Technology had a goal originally set in place; it was to simply make human life easier, and it did in some ways, however the simplicity became a habit to the way people live their everyday lives. People became reluctant without it, something so simple as to driving from point A to B became a challenge without the use of a GPS or smartphone. History tells us that in the long run technology is a net creator of jobs. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company, and former co-owner of PayPal, has created many jobs for the economy, however, in the Tesla Factory Elon Musk made it to be a highly-touted automation system. Which he thought to be better, more intelligent standard for Tesla manufacturing. He soon realized that “excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, [his] mistake. Humans are underrated. Technology cannot replace humans. Human brains and methods of doing certain thing cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence. However, artificial intelligence creates complications to a person life, creating dependency on malfunctioning technologies. Tesla known for its self-driving automobile. Soon enough humans will rely on autopilot to get them from point A to B, slowly draining the once strong knowledge of driving a car. Technological advances in big data, machine learning, and robotics, have begun to have a negative influence on existing employment opportunities for human beings. With the technology and artificial technology advancing at a rapid pace it elements people from the workplace. People won’t have to work, therefore loosing knowledge of how one does a certain job. Knowledge is one of the key factors to life, not knowing or becoming forgetful, causes harm to civilization. Technology immensely effects our culture in several ways, Entire generations are growing up under a pre-Copernican notion that the world revolves around them, thus the constant updates of what they are doing, where they are going, what they’ve purchased. It puts those generations at risk of not knowing, increased levels of complications and competitiveness to obtain an occupation. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts in people. Adolescents have been severely brainwashed, to the point of unawareness that technology has consumed, controlled, and distracted them from life itself. Technology has made our mind sensitive to oneself, have been creating a personality and different person behind a screen. Humans developed the tactic of hiding behind a screen to speak their opinion. People isolate themselves from society due to technology addiction that created psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and weakened attention spans. Technology put people to harm, removing them from their place of work. Artificial intelligence is creating replacements for humans, causing loss of knowledge for one’s skilled occupation.",Nathan James,https://medium.com/@nathan.james?source=post_page---byline--7777ae670ee---------------------------------------,50,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0,2019-01-21T18:47:44.584Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@a.golanski/mobile-apps-in-2019-10-trends-worth-to-be-highlighted-16b103f50b84?source=tag_archive---------129-----------------------,Mobile apps in 2019–10 trends worth to be highlighted,1. Chatbots,"Adam Golański Follow -- Listen Share A year ago, studies by We are social and Hootsuite revealed that the number of internet users worldwide exceeded 4 billion and the number of mobile phone users exceeded 5 billion. The average internet user was supposed to spend six hours a day using devices connected to the Internet — a quarter of his or her life. To sum it up, it would mean that in 2018 humanity spent one billion man-years on the Internet. And there is no evidence that this trend is slowing down. More and more accessible mobile Internet, better and better smartphones make us believe that in 2019 we will be even more actively integrating the Internet into our lives. This will be primarily caused bymobile applications. While a few years ago there was a lot of talk about mobile Web, HTML5 standards, mobile browsers, today it is becoming more and more obvious that this is not the right way to go. Applications have won the users’ hearts, providing more convenient access to information, entertainment, and various practical functionalities. Mobile web became at best just an addition to the applications. Websites viewed on mobile browsers are first and foremost encourage users to install mobile apps. YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Pornhub, Allegro… Although they still work in the browser, they only show their full potential on the smartphone through their client applications. The same applies to every online shop — it’s great to have a mobile website, but the conversion rate from it is far lower than from a desktop site. Even small e-shops are commissioning mobile apps in the hope that they will find a new home on the smartphone’s start screen. However, it is not only the convenience of the users that have influenced this situation. Another factor was the reduction in the cost of entering the market with a new mobile application. In 2018 only two mobile platforms remained on the market — iOS and Android. Mobile Windows, BlackBerry, Tizen or Firefox OS ceased to have any relevance. So there is no need to worry about them, no need to bear the additional costs of software development. Furthermore, React Native technology has reached maturity, thanks to which it is easy to build a mobile application that will work as well on Android as on iOS. It’s true, React Native has its limitations, but in the case of a typical enterprise or retail apps they’re not noticeable. And on the horizon, you can see one more solution. Wherever the budget is not sufficient even for creating a React Native application, it becomes possible to use Progressive Web Apps. This kind of software is installed directly from websites, without the involvement of app stores. In many cases, Progressive Web Apps can provide users with more or less the same experience as the native app. And most importantly, these apps work well enough not only on Android but also on iOS. With these factors in mind, it is not surprising that revenues from the global mobile apps market (the value of sales in stores and ads emission) are expected to reach almost 190 billion dollars in 2020. So what to expect from mobile apps in 2019? Here are the ten most important trends that we focus on in Matsuu: 1. Chatbots Nowadays more and more users prefer the self-service — this is especially visible in the B2B industry, but also individual customers like independence.Chatbots, acting as virtual assistants in sales applications, turn out to be the solution that will allow the customer to fully automate the contact with the store. According to Statista, the value of the chatbots market is expected to increase by more than a billion dollars in the coming years. They will become part of the normal user experience, their absence will be considered as something bizarre. On the one hand, it is the result of the arrival on the market the generation accustomed to communicators, on the other hand, the development of programming tools that allow the quick integration of chatbots with the existing applications. And due to the progress in artificial intelligence, with each subsequent interaction with the user, mobile apps will provide better and better responses through their chats. 2. Machine learning If we are talking about Artificial Intelligence, we must remember that it affects the progress of not only chatbots but also many other smartphone functionalities. Above all, this meansmachine learning, which allows the analysis of vast amounts of data to provide the users with a more personalized experience, and the publishers of applications with a better insight into the users’ needs. Speech recognition, image recognition, decision support, searching for the best offers — such solutions will be eagerly used in the new generation of mobile applications in the coming year. Gartner predicts that it will be the most important element of digital business in the coming years, whose value by 2022 will reach 3.9 trillion dollars. 3. Multiplatform development It is true the fact that only Android and iOS remained on the market has significantly reduced the cost of software development, but still, the need for separate software development for two systems constitutes a serious financial barrier for many customers. Fortunately, in the last two years, it became possible to meet the needs of those who do not have at their disposal large budgets thanks toReact Native. However, it is obvious that this Facebook-made technology is not sufficient for all kinds of applications. Flutter, Google’s new framework for building visually spectacular multiplatform mobile apps, has no such limitations. With the release of its first stable version in December 2018, a new wave of beautiful and powerful apps is coming, and they can be immediately published on Google Play and App Store. For now, the challenge is to find programmers who are experienced enough with the still little-known Dart language. In this language, the Flutter apps are created and they use a number of its more advanced features. 4. Augmented reality All these virtual reality goggles remain so far a curiosity for the gamers. They are simply too uncomfortable, too impractical to be used anywhere except for some types of games and perhaps a few specialized applications. However, 2019 will, in our opinion, be the year in which mobile applications will be eagerly upgraded with the technology that has grown up on the basis of VR, i.e. Augmented Reality (AR). Pokémon Go was not just a one-time fad. Thanks to the increasing performance of smartphones, it will be possible to create breathtaking mobile apps that supplement reality with additional layers of information on the fly. More and more companies will use AR to improve sales and customer communication. More and more applications will also follow Instagram and Snapchat and will be enhanced with interactive AR components, supported by Apple’sARKitand Google’sARCoretechnologies. This impresses users and is ideal for use in advertising and loyalty campaigns in social media. 5. Mobile payments and wallets Year after year, our shopping habits are changing. We replaced cash with plastic credit cards, and then start replacing them with mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies. This is because easy payments are what customers require from all sales applications. And as mobile shopping has become the primary way for an increasing number of users to buy non-food items, solutions such asGoogle Payare improving, allowing us to spend our hard-earned money quickly and safely. Thanks to them, smartphones are turning into our wallets. Now just wait for the digitalization of ID cards… In any case, according to BI Intelligence, by 2020, the value of payments made via mobile devices is expected to amount to 503 billion dollars. 6. Escape from ecosystems Apple has done everything it could to convince users to their FaceTime, even though it does not allow them to communicate with Android users. Building such closed “ecosystems” of software has become a trademark of Cupertino company, even though it has not brought the desired results. iMessage has no chance in terms of popularity with Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp available on every major platform. In this war between Apple and Google, users will increasingly choose multiplatform applications that allow for easy data transfer between systems. The main reason for this change is the desire of the younger generation to try something new from time to time. Who knows, maybe, in the end, iMessage will appear on Android, like Google Duo was released on iPhone? 7. Instant Apps In 2017, Google introducedInstant Appstechnology into Google Play — allowing users to try apps from the store immediately without the need to install them. Of course, not every application can be tested in this way, in most cases, these are equivalent to the websites. Google also allows you to easily share them with your friends. As users become more and more impatient, demanding shorter loading times, and 5G networks are still a distant future, apps will be offered more and more often in an instant form, thus eliminating the time needed to download them and install. The effects can be felt immediately — Vimeo has extended its average session time by 130 percent after being released in an instant app form! 8. Serverless backends Serverless infrastructure is a booming pattern of software architecture, which eliminates the need to create and manage your own backends from scratch. Of course, this does not mean that mobile applications will not need servers. The service provider simply becomes responsible for all the essential resources involved in delivering and scaling the application runtime environment. Thanks to such solutions asGoogle Firebase, we can simply build new software faster and cheaper, and these apps can scale almost without limitations. There is, of course, a side effect here: the software is dependent on Google infrastructure and we’re no longer in full control of application development. But if self-reliance is important, one can always choose the open source serverless solutionParse. In any case, we are going in the direction of API management rather than management of servers. 9. Data in the cloud Internet speed is increasing faster than the amount of memory available in smartphones, especially those more affordable. We can still find devices with 16GB of built-in storage, especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile, more and more applications are storing large amounts of data, taking up space and causing the user to not be able to install further applications anymore. This means that the need to integrate applications with cloud data storage services will increase. Ultimately, we believe that applications will store more and more data, including multimedia data, not locally, but in the clouds. It will also increase the ease of exchanging smartphones for new ones and increase data security. Whatever you say, an ordinary user cannot take care of them as well as a specialized service provider. 10. Motion and localization Bluetooth beacon technology appeared prematurely and failed to make a big impact on the market, but this does not mean that there is no need for this type of solutions. In 2019 an important trend in mobile applications will be motion detection and location. For this purpose, all possible techniques will be used to transmit accurate location data. Gyroscope, accelerometers, magnetometers, and GPS will be complemented with data from Bluetooth,Wi-Fiand 5G, allowing precise modelling of user movement in space, also in enclosed facilities. Motion and location detection apps can be used to pinpoint colleagues, save energy, protect against theft, and are suitable for games (including AR games), fitness, geotagging and navigation applications. These ten trends certainly do not cover the whole issue. In our industry, there are new breakthroughs occurring constantly. Smartphones and their software are solving more and more human problems, changing people’s everyday lives on a scale we could not have imagined in the previous century. We are already carrying out many of the most important tasks with the help of the apps.

The real purpose of any diet is to give the practitioner a program to help them achieve balance and harmony in their life. A diet is so much more than what foods we put into our bodies it also encompasses the quality of information that we feed our mind. My Cuban Abuelita used to tell me and my sisters as children that we were either too “flacko” or “gordo.” Life is full of ups and downs like our weight. We will experience highs and low as we follow our programs and work to achieve our goals in 2019, but the determination to pick ourselves up when we fall is essential for achieving success. My goal in 2019 is to remain moderate in my use of social media and to start socially conscious businesses that as Marc Benioff says, create a positive impact in the world. In early 2016 and after much internal debate, I decided to delete my Facebook account and have never looked back. Deleting Facebook, while extreme, did not cause me to become a complete technology recluse but provided a significant social media creative constraint and enabled me to be more conscious and intentional with how I use platforms likeInstagram,LinkedIn,Twitter,Yelp, and others. Quitting all social media for good is an extreme and unbalanced action. It is much better to learn how to practice moderation in our use of social media as it is a more sustainable path. We are living during the most significant technological revolution in human memory. Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed by a small group of very smart professions are affecting the lives of billions of people around the world. I believe that it is time for more voices from underrepresented groups in technology to be heard. For example, when I was writing the word ‘gordo’ on my iPhone, the Google Keyboard app autocorrected the word to Gordon. I don’t know anyone named Gordon in my community so why would Google AI leaders think ‘gordo’ was a typo for ‘Gordon’ if it wasn’t because for their algorithms are written by a group of mostly white men. Over the coming weeks, I plan to create two Public Benefit Corporations for new businesses that I have started usingGust LaunchandStripe Atlaswhich are the leading platforms for launching startups used by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. The first is a socially conscious business with my wife calledMinht & Honey, and the other is an artificial intelligence business with a mission to create and promote trust on the Internet calledBelievability AI. I invite you to follow me on my journey starting here, and I ask all of you to consider going on a social media diet in 2019. Please let me know if you do and share your program.",Corey Coto,https://medium.com/@coreycoto/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--818fcf7df4e1---------------------------------------,268,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg,2019-01-04T03:10:48.780Z,Medium

Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet, but for Blockchain the future is bright.",Farhang Maghdeed,https://medium.com/@farhang.maghdeed?source=post_page---byline--da902318cff2---------------------------------------,20,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png,2019-01-02T08:31:00.696Z,Medium

No one could imagine using Word and Excel, let alone AR & VR, on a brick-sized object which didn’t make you even look slick. But features such as GPRS, instant messaging and, most remarkably, intangible aspect “mobility”, revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices. Such is the case with blockchain, and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand, difficult to code, difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money, documents, bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But, it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept. How is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly, a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app, they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep. Mass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters, nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority. Sectors and projects that will move the needle in the blockchain space in 2019 will be the financial, insurance and retail industry and projects such asFilecoin,Protocol Labs,Origin, andPROPShave the possibility to become mainstream options to the present alternatives.

https://medium.com/@juris_morituri/intelligence-artificielle-et-march%C3%A9s-financiers-b89975517697?source=tag_archive---------149-----------------------,Intelligence Artificielle et Marchés Financiers,Written byAlexis Tabary,"Alexis Tabary Follow -- Share Enmatière d’abus de marché, l’IA vient poser de nouveaux défis juridiques. Ces nouveaux défis ne résultent pas de la création de nouvelles méthodes de réalisation d’abus de marché, mais du fait que les nouvelles technologies, et notamment l’Intelligence Artificielle, font que ceux-ci prennent une toute autre dimension. Au sens du Règlement n°596/2014 [1], l’abus de marché se décompose de plusieurs catégories d’infractions : les opérations d’initiés, la divulgation illicite d’informations privilégiées, et les manipulations de marchés. Si les deux premières catégories relèvent d’un accès suivi d’une divulgation d’informations non publiques dont par conséquent l’IA ne peut avoir connaissance et ne peut donc générer de risques systémiques sur les marchés, cela n’est pas le cas pour la troisième catégorie. Les manipulations de marché sont définies, à travers d’une liste non-exhaustive, à l’article 12 du Règlement, remplaçant les articles 631 et suivants du Règlement général de l’AMF. Il y est notamment mentionné certaines manipulations de cours auxquelles il faut être particulièrement attentif dès lors qu’il y a usage du Trading algorithmique à haute fréquence, (par exemple à l’article 12 2.c du Règlement). Nous étudierons, au prisme de la pratique deMarket-on-the-close(A) et de celle de l’Abusive Squeeze(B), en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle (en sa définition la plus inclusive possible) génère déjà des abus de marché afin d’illustrer les risques encourus par les marchés financiers dans le cadre d’une généralisation de ces agents autonomes. IA et Marking-the-close LeMarking-the-close[1bis]est le fait pour un agent financier de réaliser « des achats d’actions ou de dérivés à un instant très proche de fermeture du marché de façon à altérer le prix de clôture »[2]. Si un tel procédé n’est pas illégal en soi, la répétition de celui-ci dans des proportions permettant une influence sur les cours peut constituer une manipulation de cours. De plus, un tel procédé est suspectéa fortioride manipulation de cours s’il est suivi d’annulations des ordres passés. Car, pour tout investisseur extérieur, les informations disponibles sur l’état du marché de l’actif financier visé sont celles répertoriées dans le carnet d’ordres passés. Dès lors, pour une entreprise réalisant ce type de procédé, le fait d’effectuer cela à grande échelle entraîne que « la représentation pour tout opérateur du carnet d’ordres et de l’état de l’offre et de la demande […] est faussée (sic) »[3]. En effet, compte tenu du caractère anonyme des opérations passées, « l’algorithme (peut) interpréter les flux de marché avantageusement par rapport aux autres intervenants » dès lors que seul l’émetteur de l’ordre est en mesure d’identifier ses propres ordres et donc d’avoir une vision réelle des ordres qui seront par la suite maintenus et effectués. Si à ce jour, l’utilisation de ces procédés d’émission puis d’annulation d’ordres est marginale dans la mesure où le THF [3bis] demeure assez peu utilisé sur les marchés peu liquides, la généralisation des THF parmi les acteurs financiers risque d’entraîner une certaine volatilité de la valeur des valeurs financières. En effet, dans la mesure où un THF est actuellement en mesure de réaliser durant les 2 dernières secondes avant la fixation des ordres pour déterminer le prix de clôture de l’indice NASDAQ près de 70% des ordres passés dans les dernières secondes[4], dans la mesure où un grand nombre des ordres émis sont par la suite annulés, la multiplication des acteurs pouvant opérer cette volumétrie d’opérations et poursuivant la même stratégie peut amener à une incertitude de l’état réel du marché sur une valeur financière. Au travers de l’affaireSEC v. Athena Research Capital LLC, nous pouvons percevoir en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle vient perturber et accroître les risques d’abus de marché, en ce sens que les ordres sont émis à des moments de plus en plus proches de l’heure de fixation du prix de clôture, sans compter la multiplication du nombre d’ordres, complexifiant alors le travail de contrôle des teneurs de marchés. IA et Abusive Squeeze L’Abusive Squeeze[5]est le fait pour un agent financier d’user « d’une influence significative sur l’offre, la demande ou les mécanismes de livraison d’un instrument financier ou du produit sous-jacent d’un contrat dérivé, de façon à (en) distordre le prix »[6]. Si le fait d’avoir une influence significative sur une valeur financière n’est pas constitutif d’une manipulation de cours en soi, le fait d’en abuser afin d’influer sur les prix de façon à réaliser un profit en instillant une information de nature à induire en erreur tout autre investisseur sur l’état de l’offre et la demande de la valeur concernée constitue bien une manipulation de cours. Ainsi, le fait d’« effectuer une transaction, passer un ordre ou adopter tout autre comportement qui donne ou est susceptible de donner des indications fausses ou trompeuses en ce qui concerne l’offre, la demande ou le cours d’un instrument financier, d’un contrat au comptant sur matières premières qui lui est lié ou d’un produit ou d’un produit mis aux enchères sur la base des quotas d’émission »[7]est qualifié de manipulation de cours. Or, à cet effet, l’influence significative peut s’entendre comme étant absolue ou relative. Une influence significative absolue implique que l’agent financier est : à l’achat, celui ayant exercé la majorité des ordres sur la période de cotation, à la vente, celui qui dispose de la majorité des valeurs financières du marché ; une influence significative relative s’entend alors comme étant la position majoritaire d’un agent financier sur une période restreinte déterminée lui permettant d’influer sur le cours de cotation. Si l’influence absolue est sanctionnée et assez rapidement repérable, l’influence relative est plus difficile à relever dans la mesure où il faut déterminer la période restreinte en question. Ainsi, dans l’affaireSEC v. Athena Capital Research LLC[8], la période restreinte pour la détermination de l’influence significative portait sur 5 secondes. L’utilisation de l’Intelligence Artificielle, par le THF, raccourcit les délais de comparaison, la technologie aidant à exercer un impact significatif sur de courtes périodes. Par ailleurs, dans le cadre d’unAbusive Squeeze, le bénéfice de l’influence significative peut être indirect, rendant alors encore plus compliqué la détection d’une telle manipulation de cours. En effet, il est possible de chercher à manipuler un cours à la hausse ou à la baisse afin d’accroître ou réduire une performance qui est l’objet d’un contrat financier et dont dépendra le montant numéraire que la contrepartie versera. Or, dans l’affaireSEC v.Athena Capital Research LLC, l’algorithme était programmé pour réaliser des manipulations de cours à échéance et sur des valeurs humainement déterminées, la numérisation des opérations ainsi que la centralisation au sein de portefeuilles des différentes opérations rend possible qu’une IA en charge de façon autonome de la gestion d’un fonds [8bis] puisse opérer en corrélation avec les positions déjà prises par l’entreprise à des fins d’optimisation des revenus. Il apparaît donc aujourd’hui sensible l’absence de séparations quant aux systèmes utilisés par les opérateurs numériques et ceux par les opérateurs humains. Une certaine séparation permettrait d’avoir une présomption d’absence de manipulation de cours à des fins de maximisation de bénéfices indirects. Ainsi que nous l’avons vu, l’IA est source de potentiels risques sur les marchés économiques et financiers. La généralisation des intelligences artificielles au sein des divers agents financiers peut conduire à divers abus, dont certains sont déjà pratiqués dans le cadre du THF. A ce titre, certains acteurs des marchés financiers craignent que l’IA engendrent des risques systémiques[9], du fait de la volatilité que la multiplication des intelligences artificielles provoquerait sur les marchés. Mais également, l’IA pourrait conduire à une restriction de concurrence sur le marché bancaire et financier, du fait de la non-disponibilité des données relatives à la clientèle. Cette restriction de concurrence pourrait alors engendrer une situation d’oligopole entretenant des ententes implicites. Or, toute la difficulté, sur le plan juridique, est, en addition de la démonstration de l’existence de manquements, de pouvoir l’imputer à un acteur. Ainsi que vu précédemment, l’IA est susceptible de générer des risques d’infractions. Si les infractions précédemment citées sont sanctionables en cas d’actions humainement intentées, on peut néanmoins constater des difficultés sur l’imputabilité de ces infractions en présence d’une IA. Aussi, l’enjeu principal dès lors que les autorités initient une action de répréhension est l’identification de la personne juridique à qui l’infraction est imputée. l’IA ne disposant pas de personnalité juridique propre elle ne peut donc être incriminée. Dès lors, il faut déterminer la personne à incriminer des actions générées par une IA (A). Par ailleurs, les infractions exposées précédemment supposent, dans leur condamnation maximale, la présence d’une intention manifeste de l’agent économique d’enfreindre la loi. Or, dans le cas d’une IA autonome, l’intention peut s’avérer délicate à déterminer (B). L’identification de la personne à incriminer Dans la mesure où les sanctions d’abus de marchés sont de nature pénale, on peut déterminer que l’émergence de Fintech, basée sur une IA actrice de marché, rend inopérante la législation actuelle. En effet, la force de la sanction pénale est la crainte de la contrainte par corps, et conduit donc à une certaine pression psychologique sur les divers acteurs de marché. Bien qu’il soit déjà possible de sanctionner une personne n’ayant aucune existence physique (personne morale), la contrainte par corps s’exerce néanmoins à l’encontre du dirigeant responsable, la pression psychologique n’étant pas alors diffuse au sein de la personne morale, au contraire de la sanction « administrative ». Dans la mesure où l’IA ne peut être contrainte par corps, cette nature pénale de la sanction est de fait inopérante. La rationalisation des comportements d’abus de marché par une IA conduit nécessairement à ne pas rendre en compte l’aléa moral des comportements humains, notamment dans le cadre de comportement frauduleux. Dans le cadre d’une IA simple, que le CESE définit comme une « IA étroite »[11], celle-ci est programmée humainement pour réaliser des tâches spécifiques selon des méthodes et des critères définis par un agent en charge de cette programmation. L’IA est donc confinée à un rôle prédéterminé avec des paramètres fixes qu’elle ne peut altérer. Dès lors, la personne à qui la responsabilité des actions répréhensibles est imputable est celle qui a programmé l’IA. En effet, quand bien même elle agirait sur les ordres d’une partie tierce utilisatrice finale de l’IA en question, celle-ci doit déclarer aux autorités la volonté de ladite partie d’enfreindre la loi. En revanche, pour ce qui est de l’IA complexe, ou que le CESE définit comme une « IA générale », celle-ci n’est qu’initialement programmée par l’être humain. Celle-ci définira ses actions de sa propre autonomie, et pourra donc altérer les consignes imposées initialement. Isaac Asimov, par rapport aux 3 lois de la robotique qu’il avait inventées, avait relevé le problème dans sa nouvelle « LENNY » : « Puis-je vous faire remarquer […] que c’est là une pratique dangereuse ? Si l’on commence par des robots ignorants tels que Lenny, cela signifiera que l’on ne pourra jamais tabler sur le respect de la Première Loi … exactement comme cela s’est produit dans le cas de Lenny »[12]. Dès lors, à qui est imputable la faute émise par l’IA ? Dans la mesure où la faute est imprévisible, le fabricant, ou plutôt le concepteur, initial ne peut être tenu pour responsable des évolutions de l’IA, en ce sens que celle-ci sont imprévisibles et dépendent des données fournies par la personne utilisatrice. A cette fin, dans le cas présent, on pourrait donc en déduire une responsabilité de l’entreprise utilisatrice. Cependant, dans la mesure où il n’est pas attendu d’une IA qu’elle soit, dans son fonctionnement, dans l’illégalité lorsque celle-ci est mise en fonction, il apparaît difficile de sanctionner un comportement non désiré. La difficulté d’un élément intentionnel L’élément intentionnel est à prendre en compte à deux niveaux : au niveau de l’entreprise mettant en place l’IA, et au niveau de l’IA elle-même. Au niveau de l’entreprise, on peut distinguer deux situations : la première comparable à celle réalisée parAthena Capital Research LLC, soit une programmation volontaire à des fins de manipulations de cours dont le procédé pourrait être transposé dans les atteintes à libre concurrence, et la seconde où les actions frauduleuses n’étaient pas désirées par l’entreprise. Dans le premier cas, l’entreprise a manifesté une volonté d’entorse à la loi, et est donc condamnable pénalement, l’élément intentionnel étant démontrable. En ce qui concerne la seconde situation, on peut observer une différence pour les sanctions en ce qui concerne les distorsions de marché et les abus de marché. Pour les premiers, notamment en ce qui concerne les possibilités d’ententes, il est nécessaire de matérialiser une rencontre des volontés de coopérer. Or, tout l’enjeu d’une entente implicite rationnelle est l’absence de rencontre de volonté, seulement la mise en place d’un comportement rationnel à des fins d’optimisation des revenus. Dès lors, l’entente implicite ne peut être sanctionnée, dans la mesure où l’IA ne permet d’avoir qu’un parallélisme de comportements stratégiques sur la base d’informations disponibles. En ce qui concerne les abus de marché, ceux-ci peuvent faire l’objet d’une procédure pénale, mais aussi d’une procédure administrative. Si la sanction pénale nécessite la présence d’un élément intentionnel, la sanction administrative peut se contenter de relever les effets perturbateurs du fonctionnement normal du marché[13]. Au niveau de l’IA, toute la question repose désormais sur ce qu’est la volonté de réaliser l’action frauduleuse. Tout l’objet de la réflexion du sujet reposera justement sur la possibilité ou non pour une IA de réaliser volontairement une action prohibée et étant connue d’elle comme telle. Cela suppose alors, dans la programmation des IA, d’intégrer en code informatique les législations applicables. Ainsi que nous l’avons vu, les IA génèrent des difficultés pour la mise en œuvre des règles permettant de sanctionner des comportements portant atteinte aux différents marchés économiques. Si actuellement, la présence d’une sanction administrative dès constatation d’effets néfastes sur les marchés peut s’avérer une solution efficace, cette solution nécessite des évolutions allant de concert avec les évolutions technologiques à venir.

The Apple model of vertical integration is logical for incumbent auto giants and brings in technology capabilities to their current product line. However, a number of savvy companies are expanding their technology platform by licensing it to auto manufacturers. The Autonomous Technology Platform — The “Android” model The idea is pretty simple…Equip a regular car — new or existing with autonomous capabilities — by building a platform that combines the hardware/sensor/Lidars and the artificial intelligence brains. It is similar to buying a Samsung phone which at its heart is running Android O/S. By focusing on autonomous technology platform instead of the entire car, this strategy offers some unprecedented opportunities that have not seen daylight yet. The players here are diverse and fall largely in three different categories. By focusing on autonomous technology platform instead of the entire car, this strategy offers some unprecedented opportunities that have not seen daylight yet. The players here are diverse and fall largely in three different categories. The Young Turks— The first category members are auto ancillary manufacturers and allied industries that have the auto engineering know-how but tend to play at a lower spot in the auto manufacturing value chain.A classic example of this is Delphi/Aptiv.This segment has some interesting potential in the future, especially if/when it goes directly to the consumer. Imagine if they were to offer a hardware/software kit that can be installed in any modern car to make it autonomous. There is a massive incumbent market of non-autonomous cars and probably a lot of those folks would want to modernize their current chariots. With a traditional SAAS model for autonomous software/hardware’s continuing maintenance and an ‘over-the-air’ updates, combined with unlimited in-car wi-fi, auto-insurance etc., such offerings would probably result in a pretty large market cap business. Challenge — A lack of direct B2C type service delivery experience, limited understanding of software and digital interaction models may cause their offering to be too engineering like, and not have enough emphasis on end-user experience and ease of usage. The Tech Mongols— With deep technical roots to solve challenges of artificial intelligence and machine learning for autonomous driving, and equally deep pockets, these players are designing the future of transportation. These companies may have nothing to do directly with auto manufacturing but are the classic example of ‘software is eating the world’. Google/Alphabet’s WayMo and Uber fall in this category.Today, these players are focused on extending the current Uber/Lyft model and will upend the taxi market, but it won’t be surprising to see them also extend into the conversion opportunity for modern non-autonomous cars. It would seem more logical for Waymo than Uber to reach out into the existing car market, as an extension of Google’s relationship with users. After all, more data of where you go and what you do is lucrative for marketers — especially of those who are on non-Android devices and cannot be easily tracked. Challenge — Perhaps the biggest challenge for Waymo/Uber of the world is public perception and their ability to counter the apprehension of too much power in the hands of tech companies. The recent unease with social networks and Silicon Valley companies ever-increasing power is unsettling for politicians and public alike — and may cause a backlash that has nothing to do with the technical superiority of their platform. The Auto Moghuls— If you are one of the largest automakers and have made some decent inroads into the autonomous technology solution space, why not partner with your competitors and add more fuel to the autonomous platform race.GM is embracing this strategy with Hondato infuse more investment into their autonomous platform/newly sprouted start-up called Cruise. By pooling resources, this strategy enables GM and Honda to bring autonomous capabilities to their own vehicles, and also increase the sophistication of the platform itself. With their internal auto engineering expertise and world-class ability to commercialize these technologies on a global scale, Cruise will definitely be a platform to watch out for. In addition, this model lends itself well to the fleet of ‘Robo-taxis’ that GM seems interested in launching. Its the automakers getting in on Uber/Lyft/Waymo’s game. Also, for smaller automakers that do not have the economies of scope and scale for autonomous platforms, such as Subaru, Mazda, Nissan, and others, this is perhaps an attractive club to join. Challenge — Coopetition or collaborating with competitors comes with its own series of challenges. This business model has several advantages and as long as a clear framework of trust and governance is shared by the players, it can create a significant advantage. However, given the cut-throat competition in the auto market, this is a delicate balance to be maintained. Today’s car related customer service is largely deferred to dealers and other third parties — and it is a well-oiled channel management machine for most of the incumbent automakers. However, in the new world of autonomous cars — especially when they are running on a common platform, how will these services be delivered. Would they a better fit for a centrally managed call center, with sophisticated software integrations with the vehicles’ sensors and diagnostics that require a different type of skill set. How will it affect the brand perception and quality of service? It ain’t an oil change…Autonomous car users of tomorrow will want to press a button and be redirected to someone who can help with their car’s software — which may be rather different from the services that a dealer offers. It ain’t an oil change…Autonomous car users of tomorrow will want to press a button and be redirected to someone who can help with their car’s software — which may be rather different from the services that a dealer offers. Summary: The autonomous platform participants of the ‘Android’ model would need to significantly differentiate their end customer’s user experience to stay competitive in the marketplace. One can argue that cars themselves are the differentiation — as the non-autonomous ones are today. However, as we move into an era where we will drive less and tap on screens more, designing an end-user experience that hides the generic autonomous platform and offers a pleasant and branded experience will be key. The challenge with the ‘Android’ business model for autonomous vehicles is similar to the one that exists with Android phones — a clear lack of differentiation in the digital experience. The challenge with the ‘Android’ business model for autonomous vehicles is similar to the one that exists with Android phones — a clear lack of differentiation in the digital experience. As a technologist, it is a great era to be living in. As these tectonic shifts occur, we can merely marvel at the advancements that are occurring at a dizzying pace.

https://medium.com/koinex-crunch/a-new-year-of-togetherness-and-opportunities-29ced4d15725?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,A new year of togetherness and opportunities,"For the love of blockchain, let’s take 2019 to the moon!","For the love of blockchain, let’s take 2019 to the moon! Rahul Raj Follow Koinex Crunch -- 1 Listen Share The new year is here, holding within its 365 days and 8,760 hours a ton of opportunities to change the world — our world. With this thought, I, along with every member atTeam Koinex, extend the warmest wishes for 2019. I would also personally like to take a moment to thank all our users, backers and believers who stood by us throughout 2018 and because of whose blessings we are where we stand today. The year that went by Since the beginning of 2018, the digital assets and cryptocurrency market has witnessed a bumpy ride. Falling prices, fewer ICOs, unfavourable regulations and many more factors have kept the true potential of blockchain technology, decentralisation and a tokenised global economy from blossoming. For India in particular, things became worse with the introduction of the Reserve Bank of India’s directive to isolate formal banking services from the entire blockchain-based digital assets industry. This was harsh, to say the least, as a few significant exchanges shut shop in India. A bearish market, unavailability of formal banking services, lack of initiatives and finally the complete absence of regulatory clarity dealt a crippling blow to an otherwise booming technology sphere. Nevertheless, atKoinex, we choose to always look at the positive side. Everyone here is focused on solutions, not the problems. We kept our innovation going and we did our best to keep the industry alive and kicking. We created India’s most loved peer-to-peer trustful token transaction network —Loop.We also introduced a peer-to-peer INR deposit/withdrawal mechanism. We added 32 coins, 72 trading pairs across 4 markets. In addition to this, we introduced India’s first crypto gifting service and conducted numerous trading contests and competitions, giving away prizes over INR 1 crore. Along with these user-focused developments, our Engineering team worked hard on a lot of behind-the-scenes components to enhance the performance of the exchange: we built a world-class trade engine which could handle a million transactions per second. We also developed a real-time messaging service,Pushman, which filled the ticker and orderbooks with data, broadcasting millions of messages every hour. On top of the development, we continuously kept improving the security on the platform, which has always been our priority. The year that just started On top of all the things that we did in 2018, we laid out the foundation for our mission — making India a hotbed of blockchain technology development. We hosted our first#KoffeeWithKoinexmeetup in Mumbai in December 2018 which received a tremendous response; that was enough for us to gear up and plan to hold regular meetups in every part of the country in 2019. We partnered with another blockchain company in Bengaluru and co-hosted a developer-centric hands-on workshop on EOS blockchain in November 2018. We plan to organise many more hackathons and developer conferences throughout 2019. All of these only serve as a small step and contribution in building the entire blockchain ecosystem in India! More concretely, we instated a blockchain research and development team within the organisation to study the core technology in depth and build vital pieces of infrastructure which can power the next phase of adoption of Web 3.0 applications. We inaugurated a new Development Centre in Bengaluru — the startup hub of India, and we plan totriple our workforcewithin the early months of 2019. This year we will work on two major impact areas: cutting-edge research and development of sophisticated technological products/solutions, and building an active community of enthusiasts and participants. This is aligned for all our activities in accordance with our mission. We are looking forward to 2019, recovering from the unpredictability of 2018. We are energised, focused and dedicated to keep delivering on our promises and executing our vision. We believe this will put India on the global map of excellence in the field of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. In this pursuit, we invite everyone — developers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, policy makers, community spokespeople and the end-consumers — to join hands in forging a path to the future. We also encourage blockchain enthusiasts who would want to join our team to check out allopen positions at Koinex. We are actively recruiting across all major roles in all major functions (Engineering, Product, Business, Strategy, Marketing, Operations and others), including senior leadership positions. Once again, wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year! Let’s make 2019 a big success, together! Once again, wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year!

https://medium.com/@dhanush_ramuk/reasons-behind-the-decline-in-the-sales-of-iphone-4c0b5e67b1f6?source=tag_archive---------44-----------------------,Reasons behind the decline in the sales of iPhone.,Written byDhanush,"Dhanush Follow -- Listen Share Yesterday, Tim Cook released a letter to Apple’s investor explaining what many already knew that iPhone sales are slowing around the world and in turn, it’ll reduce the revenue for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter. Tim Cook’s letter. What led to this?There are a variety of reasons to be factored but, I think that Apple overplayed its hand in raising the prices of iPhone to the extent that even loyal Apple fan like me hated. The smartphone market has begun to saturate and, the room for growth is steadily declining. Apple knew this already and, in 2017 they increased the price of iPhone touching 1000 dollars to combat the decline in the sale of iPhone. Apple got away with this cause the iPhone X brought loads of features compared to its previous model and, people didn’t care much to pay 1000 dollars to get the unique iPhone in their hand. Apple should have been confident then to increase the prices of iPhone last year to meet the slowdown in sales but, it backfired mainly cause the latest model looked same as previous models. Apple should have brought some compelling features to justify the price hike other than new color and bigger size but, the things didn’t turn out the way Apple had hoped. Even the budget iPhone XR was turned away by the people which led to never before marketing and trade in programs seen by the Apple. There are other problems too contributing to lackluster sales of iPhone but, the price is what that disappointed even the most loyal fans. Of course, Tim Cook didn’t mention this in his letter to the investors. He cited China and its economy as a prime problem. Yes, China has been Apple’s headache for years mainly cause of the decline in the economy and the trade wars which may very well increase the iPhone prices again all over. China is Apple’s second largest market after the U.S and, the things are not looking well as Trump threatens to increase the tax price of products coming out of China to the U.S including iPhone. Apple soon needs to reduce its dependence on China and needs to look other emerging smartphone markets like India for manufacturing and increasing sales. Other things that led to this decline are the cheap battery replacements and iOS 12. Even Tim Cook stated cheap battery replacements contributed to the sales decline, this combined with iOS 12 which increases the performance of older iPhone's and, people were hesitant to exchange their iPhone when they could get increased performance out of their older iPhone's by exchanging their battery for cheap and updating to optimized iOS 12. Now, you’ll be seeing a lot of negative reports about Apple but, you should know that this is not the end or doom of Apple. In the same letter, Tim Cook has mentioned that its non-iPhone business which includes services, Mac, iPad, and wearable are doing remarkably well. If you are an Apple fan like me, then be patient and keep faith cause if any company can go through this phase, its Apple. Yes, iPhone is the core business for Apple but, that’s about to diversify with its Streaming service that’ll launch soon, Augmented reality headsets and quite possibly Apple car.

https://medium.com/@john_lightle/our-kids-got-smartphones-why-im-okay-with-this-seeing-the-potential-not-just-disasters-d30ad76d63bc?source=tag_archive---------78-----------------------,"Our Kids Got Smartphones — Why I’m Okay With This, Seeing The Potential, Not Just Disasters",Written byJon Lightle,"Jon Lightle Follow -- Listen Share We gave our kids their own phones recently. They are 7 and 9. Some parents may say it’s the norm these days, some may say my wife and I are bad parents by encouraging entitilement and so on. I disagree, with this highly, if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all, how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough, even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.) Working from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool), my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom, checking email, making a post, sharing a story on instagram, researching, and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things, they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology. It’s not their fault, look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too, pondering what do adults do with these things. Actually, tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos, taking pictures with legos, and how to make apps. Last year, we sold the iPad, the iPod touch was long gone, and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials, videos for schoolwork, crafts and reviews for toys. Not long after they wanted to learn to make their own videos just like these. This was ok for awhile, however there were times I had needed to get a call made, a text out, a text back, an email out, a post made, spend time engaging, and in all honesty I was becoming frustrated. And that’s when my wife and I considered the idea of our kids having the responsibility of a phone. Sure, they could just have an iPad to do this, but this came down to cost for us. Yesteryears iPhones are much cheaper than they were before and my kids didn’t have to have latest and greatest. Just something small enough to take with them, snap pictures, record video and contact us if there was an emergency. In a sense, having their own phone was no different from having an iPad, just now they would use cellular data. What’s more is with recent updates on time limits for screen time and more security for kids I was really warming up to the possibility. I also knew at some point they would have to learn about saftey online and I couldn’t shield them from everything. There was one surprising idea that really opened the door for me on this issue. The internet of today has shifted social media and mobile engagement. For some time now businesses are utilizing Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. It’s not just big businesses, it’s little shops in towns, the auto repair shop and the bakery just blocks away. They’re using the live features, posting news, specials and engaging with customers on social media. As an example, a small local baby shop selling cloth diapers, natural baby soaps and toys is posting to stories and live video showcasing products and answering questions from customers viewing the feed. My point to this, is that my kids are seeing this, they’re seeing me do it too, as a freelance illustrator I have to engage in this social world as this is where the world is today. I don’t know what the future entirely holds for jobs and so on but I’d have to say this is a great time for them to learn where things are today. My kids are interested in making videos, they want to share their ideas, wild as they maybe to the world. They don’t know what they want to be when they grow up yet, but they’re willing to figure it out along the way. I know there is some backlash on letting kids have phones and using social media but what if it helped them solve problems going on in the world, what if it helped them take their ideas and make impact on someones life. Whether you agree or not, I feel like our children deserve to know the truth of where the worlds attention is, learn about issues going, and being an active part of this period of time. Yes I agree, there are lots of bad things in the digital world, but there is also lots of bad things in the real world. By holding our kids back, we could be losing kids who want to make the world a better place in the future. With some guidance and effort, we can can help our children see mobile technology as a tool for change, instead of our perception as these devices as a fun toy.",Jon Lightle,https://medium.com/@john_lightle?source=post_page---byline--d30ad76d63bc---------------------------------------,1,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Mte3SMLJKyBMPZZQ4AGLOQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Mte3SMLJKyBMPZZQ4AGLOQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Mte3SMLJKyBMPZZQ4AGLOQ.jpeg,2019-01-01T11:51:50.416Z,Medium
https://medium.com/tech-2025/16-free-online-courses-on-emerging-technologies-and-global-innovation-that-will-prepare-you-for-ce7f5292d420?source=tag_archive---------132-----------------------,16 Free Online Courses On Emerging Technologies and Global Innovation that Will Prepare You for the Future of Work,Published inTECH 2025,"Charlie Oliver Follow TECH 2025 -- Listen Share In the two years since we first launched Tech 2025, back in January 2017, we’ve learned that the primary reason people attend our events on any given topic is because they are curious about the topic or a particular aspect of the topic that we highlight in our event marketing. Many of our attendees aren’t necessarily advanced in (or very knowledgeable about) the technologies we cover. They come to us curious, wanting to see something that sparks their internal, creative compass — even if they have no idea what that “something” might be. It’s safe to say that we’re all a bit overwhelmed with the number of disruptive emerging technologies emerging and developing simultaneously, each one promising to change global industries and the very nature of our reality in a mere next ten years: AI, machine learning, AR/VR/XR, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, gene-editing biotech, robots, automation — oy! Where to begin?! Imagining the future and your place in it has never been so complicated. Knowledge is power, but curiosity is queen. As hard as it may sometimes be (we’re all busy and eternally distracted), in order to learn about the true potential impact of technology and to find our place in the ecosystem, we must feed our curiosity by constantly and substantively learning about the systems and ideas that are at the core of emerging technologies, including how global innovation happens, morals and ethics of businesses, corporate management and structure, societies and social science, etc. These technologies are challenging us to redefine who we are and what we want. The obvious question is: who are we and what do wereallywant? Don’t let your curiosity go to waste. It’s your most powerful tool. It’s the anchor that will steady you in turbulent times as technologies and big ideas come and go. Learn and relearn what you thought you already knew. Revisit old concepts, learn new ones, and challenge current systems and ways of thinking. You don’t necessarily have to jump into the deep-end of the pool by taking expensive, months-long, courses in AI and machine learning that will require technical expertise you don’t have or necessarily want right now. You can start the new year learning about concepts at the core of emerging technologies or the industries that are adopting them. With this knowledge, regardless of the market volatility, you’ll be able to think through what’s happening now, how the latest developments might impact your business, and what’s coming next. I’ve gathered a short list of free online courses that helps us to see “the big picture” and focus on the problems emerging technologies are being created to solve, as opposed to the technology itself (and even the problems that are arising as we implement technologies like algorithmic bias). I’ll be adding more to this list in parts 2 and 3 of this series in the coming weeks. Invite people in your network (friends, family, coworkers) to join you on this journey. It’s one well worth taking and a great way to kick off the new year! Università Bocconi on Coursera Started (started 24th Dec, 2018) We live in an increasingly interconnected world and the technologies of the near future will make us even more interconnected. As China, the US and other nations race to become leaders in AI, understanding international leadership and organizational behavior during technological transition will become crucial. This course is a great place to start. Course Description:Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. In this course… we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Presented by 23andme The world was horrified by the news that He Jiankui (a Chinese scientist) created the world’s first babies genetically modified with CRISPR (twin girls with a potential third baby on the way) and, if that weren’t enough to sound alarms, his work was (according to fellow scientists), sloppy and full of errors (Is the CRISPR baby controversy the start of a terrifying new chapter in gene editing?). The global science community is still grappling to understand the implications of this shocking story. Here’s how you can begin to understand the technology, why what Jiankui did was considered to be so dangerous, and how you can participate in the discussion — take this course! After you take this course, consider taking this edX course,Analyze Your Genome! Course Description:This course is a journey into the biology of the human genome and will highlight the scientific, social, and personal perspectives of people living with a variety of traits. You will learn about fundamental principles of inheritance, gene expression, mutation and variation, development of simple and complex biological traits, human ancestry and evolution, and the acquisition of personal genetic information. By the end of this course, you will be able to read and understand genetic information available from personal genetics services such as23andMe. Presented by Microsoft (started December 31) The need for taking this course (and its potential benefits) is pretty self-explanatory. As AI and machine learning technologies take over every part of our society, contentious issues surround ethics and fairness will grow (particularly in corporate and government sectors). Here’s a great introduction to the legal framework around the topic. There are NO prerequisites for this course. Any and everyone can participate. Course Description:Analytics and AI are powerful tools that have real-word outcomes. Learn how to apply practical, ethical, and legal constructs and scenarios so that you can be an effective analytics professional. Corporations, governments, and individuals have powerful tools in Analytics and AI to create real-world outcomes, for good or for ill. Data professionals today need both the frameworks and the methods in their job to achieve optimal results while being good stewards of their critical role in society today. In this course, you’ll learn to apply ethical and legal frameworks to initiatives in the data profession. You’ll explore practical approaches to data and analytics problems posed by work in Big Data, Data Science, and AI. You’ll also investigate applied data methods for ethical and legal work in Analytics and AI. The University of Chicago (started December 31) Without a doubt, 2018 was the year of “Techlash” where big tech companies were challenged on their technologies, ethics and morals, by governments around the world, consumer advocacy groups, and even their own employees. How this all ends is anyone’s guess. We’ll be exploring this topic extensively at Tech 2025 this year. Here’s a great course that will lay a solid foundation for learning about how tiny startups become mega-platforms and achieve global dominance. Course Description:This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government. And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks. This course will cover 7 topics: Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet, Google Emerges (and the World Responds), Smartphones, Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality, The Day the Music Died?, Video: Listening and Watching, The Mediated Book. KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Elon Musk is promising to get us to Mars by 2025. Whether he will or won’t, the fact is, we’re headed to Mars one way or another regardless of who gets us there first (and it will be sooner than later). The privatization of space travel is creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to participate in space travel like never before. And companies like Space X and Virgin Galactic are accepting space tourists for the lucky few who can afford it. This course offers a great overview of the history of human space flight. If you want to be inspired by space tech, this course will give you that spark! Course Description:Learn about human space travel from an experienced ESA astronaut who flew on Space Shuttle Discovery to conduct research on the International Space Station. This applied science course introduces aspects of human spaceflight, including the various environmental, medical and technical challenges of space travel. Join Christer Fuglesang, Director of KTH Space Center, and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut, during this 5-week course in which Christer makes human spaceflight both accessible and engaging. Christer often draws on his own experiences as an astronaut which include two Space Shuttle missions and five spacewalks. RWTH Aachen University (archived course) Course Description:Learn to take on competition by creating successful and innovative ideas for your business through a thorough understanding of your customers’ needs. Addressing the needs of your customers is the core factor of managing innovation successfully. Exactly this is the task of the first stages of an innovation project. In this course, you will learn about key concepts and methods of generating customer-centric business ideas and innovative concepts. After completing this course you will improve your career qualifications asProduct Manager,Engineer,Process ManagerandMarketing Manager. Learners from the industries ofProduct Management,Engineering,Innovation ManagementandCustomer Relationship Managementalready completed the course as well asConsultantsandEntrepreneurs. University of Michigan (2–4 hours to complete) We did an event on universal basic income in 2017, Silicon Valley,Universal Basic Income and the Future of Work, to explore how Silicon Valley was embracing basic income as a possible (if not temporary or limited) solution to the economic hardship that will likely arise from technological disruption like automation. Back then, hopes were high. Like so many other stories in emerging tech last year, this one came crashing back down to reality as cities around the world that had initially launched Basic Income pilot programs to test its potential, pulled their test program abruptly and early including Ontario and Finland. In an article early last year, the publicationMotherboard, cried foul:Basic Income Is Being Set Up to Fail.But just because early trials are failing (for whatever reason) that doesn’t mean Basic Income is dead. Quite the contrary, like the emerging technologies experiencing a cold 2019, UBI is likely going through growth pains as societies globally try to figure out what economic model will work. This short course will offer a great overview and food for thought! Course Description:The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty, a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and can’t make ends meet. Basic income, the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis, remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out, you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs. University of Lausanne (Switzerland) Course Description:This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. Wesleyan University So you want to change the world? This course is cut and dry — and plenty thought-provoking. Nothing is every as easy as it seems, least of all, changing the world. This is a good place to start. Course Description:How can we use the things we share in common to address some of the most challenging problems facing the world? This course examines issues concerning poverty, the environment, technology, health care, gender, education and activism to help us understand better how to initiate positive change. The University of New South Whales (starts January 2) The future will be defined by both technologists and storytellers (among others, of course). This course will provide an overview of storytelling across platforms using various technologies — including the challenges of working with new technologies (AR/VR/XR) to tell stories created for traditional media. Transmedia storytelling is the practice of designing, sharing, and participating in a cohesive story experience across multiple traditional and digital delivery platforms — for entertainment, advertising and marketing, or social change. How do the professionals develop such expansive narratives? How do they ensure that each element stays true to the original story? How do they innovatively use different technologies to share the stories, grow audiences and create an active and involved community of fans? More and more, we are also engaging with elements or franchises of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms like interactive web experiences, social media communities, mobile devices, theme parks, and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms. Università Bocconi (started December 24) Nations across the world are preparing to upgrade their old, dilapidated infrastructures to Smart Cities of the future and, as a result, will not only be preparing for emerging technologies and the challenges they will bring, but they are also looking for ways to fund major infrastructure upgrades. This course is a great primer for understanding where the money will come from to build Smart Cities. Course Description:Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030. Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. Copenhagen Business School (starts January 21) Technologies like AI, machine learning and VR/AR have already begun to dramatically change how consumers shop and how brands deliver experiences to them. One of the biggest problems innovation and marketing teams face is understanding which technologies to implement to engage consumers, how to do it smartly, and what to with the data. This course will help anyone looking to answer these questions understand consumer behavior according to new neuroscience research. Course Description:How do we make decisions as consumers? What do we pay attention to, and how do our initial responses predict our final choices? To what extent are these processes unconscious and cannot be reflected in overt reports? This course will provide you with an introduction to some of the most basic methods in the emerging fields of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing. You will learn about the methods employed and what they mean. You will learn about the basic brain mechanisms in consumer choice, and how to stay updated on these topics. The course will give an overview of the current and future uses of neuroscience in business. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (starts January 2) Our event last year (The Last Mile: an $80 Billion Global Logistics Problem and the Blockchain Solution) which reviewed how startup Fr8 is using blockchain technology to change last-mile logistics and supply chain management for the better, offered great insights into this topic. With e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart in fierce competition to define and dominate supply chains in the future, and technologies like automation, autonomous vehicles and blockchain set to disrupt our entire global supply chain, this course is an ideal foundation for learning about supply chain management before delving into learning about how technology will disrupt them. Course Description:As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving. Delft University of Technology Electric cars aren’t just the future, they’re the present! If you’ve been wondering what all of the Tesla/electric battery hoopla is about, take this 4-week course. It offers a thorough overview of electric car space from the policy perspective (something that doesn’t get nearly as much coverage in the media and Elon Musk’s tweets). Course Description:Learn about the role of public policy in steering technological innovation and infrastructural change toward zero-emission mobility. Electric cars are more than a novel means of mobility. They have been recognized as an essential building block of the energy transition. Fulfilling their promise will imply a significant change in the technical, digital and social dimensions of transport and energy infrastructure. As the massive adoption of electric mobility will deeply change our society and our individual routines, government intervention is called for. If you are interested in learning about the roles of government in shaping the transition towards electric mobility and renewable energy systems, then this is the course for you. In this course, you will explore the promise of electric mobility from different public policy perspectives and different levels of government, and learn how they interact. After completing this course, you will be able to assess a policy plan to support the introduction of electric cars and make a motivated choice between alternative policy instruments. In the final week, the course will be concluded by connecting the different track perspectives. University of London International Programmes (starts January 21) With the launch of our Mission AI program last Summer, Tech 2025 has made a firm commitment to helping our members to learn about (and participate in) AI research. We believe strongly that, while not everyone will necessary want to (or needs to) learn how to develop AI and machine learning technologies to be part of developing it, everyone benefits (including the entire AI ecosystem) if the public is as least reasonably fluent in understanding how research is done, funded, and used. We’ve already hosted several events on this topic including,Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ResearchandPreparing for Battle Against Malicious Artificial Intelligence. Both events were packed with people eager to learn the latest research. This course is a great introduction to research methods and the (academic) research ecosystem. Course Description:The course will appeal to those of you who require an understanding of research approaches and skills, and importantly an ability to deploy them in your studies or in your professional lives. In particular, this course will aid those of you who have to conduct research as part of your postgraduate studies but do not perhaps have access to research methods courses, or for those of you who feel you would like additional support for self-improvement. No prior knowledge or experience in research is required to take this course and as such, the course is for everyone. In 2015, the course was nominated for the prestigious Guardian University Award for its innovative approach to online learning. Purdue University (starts January 7) With Silicon Valley and tech companies facing increasing backlash for their lack of diversity and inclusion policies, and the demand for companies in general to be more inclusive and culturally sensitive, taking a course like this seems like a good bet regardless of your background. This is a discussion that will undoubtedly stay at the forefront of the tech and business industry in the coming years as they grapple with developing technologies that are inclusive and representative of the true fabric of society. Course Description:Learn how to create a more inclusive world. Many things contribute to an individual’s identity, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, appearance, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, education, and political beliefs. These things, and more, are what make each of us different. So how can we learn to embrace these differences, and celebrate them? Or to put it in a different way — how can we explore and welcome diversity? This course will help you develop your knowledge and understanding of diversity, equipping you to create more inclusive and open environments that are welcome to all. Topics covered include: Phases of diversity dexterity, Attitudes, skills, and knowledge supporting diversity, Unconscious biases, Ethnocentric and ethno-relative mindsets, Elements of diversity and inclusion.

https://medium.com/@alitech_2017/top-10-technology-trends-in-2019-predicted-by-alibaba-damo-academy-8e5350fa7452?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019 Predicted by Alibaba DAMO Academy,Written byAlibaba Tech,"Alibaba Tech Follow -- 1 Listen Share FromAlibaba DAMO Academy Machine intelligence has already been generating great impacts on our life while we are still used to the era shaped largely by information revolution and mobile internet. Advanced technologies, functioning like “magics”, are developed based on rules and trends spotted by human beings. Today, Alibaba DAMO Academy published The Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019. We hope that by grasping the pace of revolution of technologies, we can make better use of these “magics” and be in charge of our own future. Dynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019. With cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud. For AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing. Deep learning technology has matured significantly. GNNs that combine with deep learning can link end-to-end learning and inductive reasoning together, which might be able to address issues, such as relational reasoning and explainability that couldn’t be tackled by deep learning before. Robust GNNs can function as a human brain that consists of neurons (or nerve cells), equipping machines with common sense, comprehension and cognitive capabilities. Computing architecture will be restructured to meet the demands for data centers and edge computing. In the future, computing, storage and networks should meet the request of high-throughput computing for AI development, as well as the request for low power in Internet of Things scenarios. The heterogenous computing architecture with FPGA, GPU and ASIC, along with emerging memory devices, are driving the evolution of traditional computing architecture. In the foreseeable future, the fundamental changes to computing architecture, underscored by the transition from CPU-centered general computing to Domain-specific computing driven by applications and technology, will accelerate the arrival of AI and the quantum-computing era. The fifth generation of wireless technology (5G) will see a significant increase of wireless bandwidth, enhancing the peak speed of 4G network nearly 100 times. This will speed the development of 4k/8k ultra-high-definition videos and immersive interaction based on AR/VR. With connection capability reaching billions of devices, it will enable thorough integration of communication and connection between machines. Networks will gradually evolve into the cloud or become software-based. Networks could also be segmented into multiple virtual subnets that are independent and parallel, offering dedicated virtual private networks for various applications. Additionally, with features like high reliability, low latency and large capacity, 5G networks will enable the development of new areas, such as vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems and the Industrial Internet. Biometric technology is maturing and being applied large scale. With the wide adoption of 3D sensors and integration of multiple models of biometric features, each device will be equipped with machine intelligence to see and hear the world. Biometric and liveness detection/anti-spoofing technology is reshaping people’s identification and verification, which will make your digital identity a sort of second ID card. From phone unlock, door access control to dining at restaurants, checking out at supermarkets, entering train stations, passing airport security check and seeing doctors in hospitals, biometric technology is playing an increasingly important role in making trust simpler and our daily life better. Making individual cars smarter hasn’t worked out well in the past to achieve autonomous driving. However, this does not mean that self-driving has hit a roadblock and is stuck forever. The advance of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems will foster the development of autonomous driving. In the next two to three years, new technological progress should be seen in certain commercial areas, such as logistics and transportation, with fixed-route public transport and unmanned delivery for commercial buildings and campuses. People are more rational about the prospects of blockchain, which was once much overhyped. The deployment of blockchain applications with sustainable commercial value is expected to speed up. Along with the rapid digitization of various industries, IoT technologies will underpin the trusted mapping from off-chain world into on-chain data, and blockchain will expedite the restructuring and optimization of trusted data flow across participants to boost the efficiency of workflow and coordination. More and more blockchain applications will be seen in our daily life, such as cross-border remittances, supply-chain financing, electronic invoices and tamper-proof judicial records. As the value of “chaining” becomes more recognized, layered architecture and cross-chain protocol will become the focus of technology to scale up blockchain infrastructure. Governments around the world intend to enact/implement more stringent policies and regulations on data security. Corporates will need to invest more in protecting individual data privacy. Though cyberattacks won’t cease in the next few years, data-protection technologies will boom. Traceability technologies across systems, such as watermark, and data-asset protection technology, including advanced anti-crawlers against strong cyberattacks, will be more broadly adopted.

The paradigm of media is changing, with the evolution from traditional media centered on devices to intelligent and integrated media. Changes in the media industry (1) Viewers are no longer limited to time of broadcasting to watch (2) The use of smartphone has increased and media contents became personalized as well. (3) Taste for media contents are being differentiated from popular and common ones into personalized ones Viewers(consumers) are get used to purchase contents from various fields including broadcast, music, movies, etc. from digital platform. Backside these systems, however, are problems such as unfair distribution of revenue and copyright infringement between contents creators and distribution platforms. Then what is Blockchain technology and how can it change the media industry? Blockchain refers to a decentralized information sharing(storing) technology that allows you to trust each other without intermediaries when dealing with a large number of unknown parties online using distributed ledger. With Blockchain technology, we expect media industry to be changed as follow: (1) Improve existing unfair revenue structure by eliminating intermediaries (2) Change the copyright payment system(contents registered in the blockchain clearly specifies the copyright holder and settlement can be automatically paid to the copyright holder when the content is sold) (3) Everyone can see the payment history for a particular movie or TV series and see transparently how the payment was distributed among the parties involved. (4) Direct relationship between consumers and artists can facilitate healthy ecosystem. (5) A reliable reputation system can be built. This is because public reputation for a particular image can be accurately recorded in the block and is impossible to be fabricated. Blockchain has the key to resolving the limitation of trust and monopoly. Blockchain technology is being introduced to the entire industry including media. We are looking forward to what solutions blockchain can offer and what the future will be.",Creative Rocket Platform,https://medium.com/@crpspace?source=post_page---byline--ce2f5114f82f---------------------------------------,0,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cHO0Sp39IABmoen8l78ndQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*8znWuWXYeTTeNhrVfdgK2A.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*8znWuWXYeTTeNhrVfdgK2A.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*8znWuWXYeTTeNhrVfdgK2A.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*cHO0Sp39IABmoen8l78ndQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*cHO0Sp39IABmoen8l78ndQ.png,2019-01-03T08:09:49.619Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@marta.p/digital-humanities-and-where-to-find-them-a7e34f80f8c8?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,Of code and culture: Digital Humanities and where to find them,"In-between humanities and technology, a new field is emerging and many are still afraid to approach it","In-between humanities and technology, a new field is emerging and many are still afraid to approach it Marta P. Follow -- 3 Listen Share Even in such a broad area like the humanities, a certainty seems to float around the life and work of any graduate of such arts: anything to do with the likes of Chaucer and Wilde has hardly anything in common with code and algorithms. That is to say, tech? Not on my critical analysis of late 14th century poems. This notion has been taken for granted for a very long time, becausestudents and professionals hardly found themselves studying on both sides of the academic pond, dabbling in both ancient writings and less ancient coding. Luckily enough, the times are a-changing. A more diverse environment in tech is slowly emerging, and this does not refer solely to more gender mix and more skin colors. Thanks to the availability of tools for the strong-willed, programming is now more accessible to people with the most variegated backgrounds. Not having a traditional technical education can now also be an advantage in new ways. To get your hands on your code editor after your head has travelled to exotic mind-lands — those of art, and literature, and linguistics — can make you approach this field with completely different eyes than your desk neighbor, because you have seen so many, and so disparate, things. And it’s there that you can accomplish the coolest feat of all: manage to see even further, build on your previous experience to discover new conceptual territories. When it comes to the humanities, and specifically literature and new media, some people have already announced new land on the horizon. This is a place where metaphorical keycaps and quilts come together to enrich each other; where nobody is lame for reading classics nor for counting their words and analyzing their contents. Cue: the Digital Humanities. These lands might be unruly and wild, difficult to explore, but they are also home to incommensurable treasures. The name alone suggests an opposition: the humanities, study area that represents all that is inherently art in the world, have now acquired a companion term that represents the future:digital. Using the digits. Critical analysis of literary texts can now be aided by powerful software tools that can read and synthesize books in mere seconds; we are talking amounts of books you could not read in decades. Investigative stylometry can help a great deal with authorship problems, like when the Computational Stylistic Group found that acclaimed Italian writer Elena Ferrante not only is not who she says she is —it has probably been her husband all along. Now-forgotten citiesbecome alive from mere mapsof times long gone.The miracle of word, paper, and brain on fire is given yet extra superpowers bydigits. Numbers and words, binary and vocabulary, forever united. Or is it the case? Itcouldbe the case. Upon exploration of this young field, however, it seems like there is a hangup. And what could it be the hangup for such a happy party? Why, the guests, of course. Ok but what are the Digital Humanities and why do I keep capitalizing it (them)?! It’s 2018, Google it. Actually, just check outthis link. It is a page that once refreshed shows a different definition. This is how uncertain these waters are. Here is my favorite, by Paul Youngman: Digital Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible — IT and the humanities. […] The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange. These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale. They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange. Digital Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible — IT and the humanities. […] The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange. These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale. They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange. More precisely, the digital tools we all keep blabbering about is in fact the same technology you heard of when nerding out about, for example, chatbots. Data analysis, when the data is text, is the same thing. Text analysis, text mining, natural language processing that can be used to teach Siri to know whether you are saying “I want pizza” or “Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 9 AM” and act accordingly are all tools from the same box.However, the same tools don’t need to be necessarily used to teach robots to call you a cab; in fact, they can be as easily manoeuvred in order to find out whether Shakespeare took credit for his interns’ work or to discover theincredible colors of the Gothic novel.And this is when the Digital Humanities were born: when some humanists were like,wait a minute, I can use this. Waking up after the long frozen sleep of theAI winteralong Machine Learning and stemming from it, the Digital Humanities didn’t exactly manage to catch the hype train; and that makes sense. DH (for friends) is not sparkling, is not the latest technological achievement that shines a light on the future; if anything, the light falls on our past and our present. To say it all, it might be more of a human accomplishment rather than a technological advancement. In truth, what makes DH a scary pond is the fact that it lacks an officially recognized definition; that the two sides it touches, the institutions of technology and literary academia, both look at it with uncertainty and lack of trust. And who can blame them, really? DH is a strange place. Humanists find themselves confrontingdistant reading tools that are thrown at them in one hour long workshops. Names like R and Python sound odd and undesirable and remind people of British comedy groups. The programming happens under the hood of tools with GUIs that can make you nostalgic of the early 2000s with their boxy looks.Or it happens in the rooms and on the desks of those who know all about text mining and sentiment analysis, and yet they do not think about its possibly Shakespearean ramifications. As Underwood suggests, there are no(t yet) real and proper academic approaches to suggest those. “The questions we try to answer are taught in the humanities. But the methods we use are taught, right now, in the social sciences and data science”. All we have is a bunch of tools and capabilities and expertise to build a fascinating, powerful machine, divided among different people who don’t talk much to each other. The problem has several different causes: not enough digital libraries are available to the curious, not enough is known of the DH to begin with; not enough is taught to graduates of both humanities and technological disciplines about one another. And why should it be done, after all? It was never really done before. The very nature of this problem is, in this way, very human. Innovation is usually very quick when it does not concern stereotypes and hard-to-lose human habits of the sort. While the tools for a deeper exploration of literary nature through a technological lense exist already or easily could, the commonplace concerning engineers and humanists normally depicts them far, far apart from each other. Categorization is, in this context, a very tall obstacle.A programmer, a data explorer, a software dweller can hardly fit the image of a poetry connoisseur. At the same time, he or she who is knee-deep into Victorian literature is not usually portrayed as possibly digitally and technologically literate as well.My wish by putting out this write-up for all to see is to send out the reminder that he or she can always, at any time, wear both shoes, embrace both worlds. And now that labels are gradually becoming obsolete, we can make them old and dusty even here, between words and digits, paper and screen. In this place, no-man’s land, work can become a lavish territory where labels do not matter more than curiosity and adventure. If you find poetry in code and linguistic codes in poetry, if you are equally charmed by papers and screens, keep looking. This is what it is all about.",Marta P.,https://medium.com/@marta.p?source=post_page---byline--a7e34f80f8c8---------------------------------------,254,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg,2019-01-03T16:56:07.637Z,Medium
https://medium.com/ktrade/technology-trends-in-2019-predicted-by-alibaba-damo-academy-more-cities-will-be-powering-an-417ab53ef494?source=tag_archive---------152-----------------------,Technology Trends in 2019 Predicted By Alibaba DAMO Academy: More cities will be powering an intelligent “city brain”.,Published inStatecraft Tech,"Statecraft Tech Follow Statecraft Tech -- Listen Share 【Published by Ding Bao Xiu (丁宝秀)】 On January 2nd, Damo Academy has released the “Top 10 Trends of Science and Technology” in 2019, covering smart cities, digital identity, autonomous driving, graph neural network systems, AI chips, blockchains, 5G. Alibaba’s Damo Academy has focused people on cutting-edge technologies that truly create value, providing theoretical support and a source of imagination for the technology development of 2019. In 2019, AI remains the hottest topic in the tech world. If 2018 is the year of AI steps out from laboratory and step in​​to our reality “world”, we believe in 2019 is the year of a new starting point for the full cooperation between humans and AI tech. Damo Academy believes that real-time speech generation on mobile devices may not be distinguishable from live voice, and even voice AI will pass the Turing test in some specific conversations. There will be more and more talking facilities in our cities in the future. Damo Academy believes that biometrics will enter a large-scale application phase in 2019. In the past few years, many people have become accustomed to going out without a wallet and cash. In the future, the era of going to the world without an ID card will not be too far away. With the rapid spread of 3D sensors and the integration of multiple biometrics, each device can “see” and “listen” which in other words, they become “smarter”. Biometric and vivo technologies will reshape identity and certification. Digital identity will become the person’s second identity card. In addition, the Damo Court believes that in 2019, 5G will lead to a new application scenario, 5G will greatly enhance mobile bandwidth, provide a peak rate of nearly 100 times that of 4G, and enhance connectivity to 10 billion levels. At the Yunqi Conference (The Computing Conference) in Hangzhou in 2018, the release of Hangzhou City Brain 2.0 made people once again shocked. The ability of the city’s brain has expanded from the transportation field to the fine management of society, including fire protection, urban construction and environment. Damo Academy believes that more and more cities in China will have urban brains. At the same time, real-time urban simulation is possible, urban local intelligence will be upgraded to global intelligence, and more power will be developed in the future for urban brain technology and application research. On the physical city, full-time perception, full-element linkage, and full-cycle iteration will be born. The smart city has greatly promoted the optimization of urban governance. In 2018, auto-driving technology development was like in a roller coaster. From the capital companies to the general trend, the automatic driving winter was once rampant. Damo Academy believes that simply relying on the “cycling intelligence” to innovate the car will not be able to meet the greatest driverless for a long time, but it does not mean that the automatic driving is completely moving into the winter (bear market). The road-to-technical route will speed up the arrival of driverless. In the next 2–3 years, the commercialization of autonomous driving, represented by limited scenes such as logistics and transportation, will usher in new progress. Commercial scenes such as fixed-line bus, unmanned distribution, and park micro-circulation will quickly land. While we are embarrassing new technologies, we need to aware the safety and risk that technologies will bring to us. Therefore, network security will continue to be a hot topic in 2019. The Damo Academy believes that in the next few years, hackers and black market attacks will not stop, but data security protection technology will be launched soon. Governments will tend to introduce more stringent data security policies and regulations, and companies will invest more in personal data privacy protection. Cross-system data tracking and tractability related technologies will be more widely used. Hereare the top 10 trends the Academy forecasts for 2019: 1. Cities Get Smarter: Real-Time Urban Simulation Becomes Possible Dynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019. 2. Speech AI Applications to Pass the Turing Test With cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud. 3. Specialized AI Chips on the Rise For AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing. 4. Giving Machines ‘Common Sense’ Deep learning technology has matured significantly. GNNs that combine with deep learning can link end-to-end learning and inductive reasoning together, which might be able to address issues, such as relational reasoning and explainability that couldn’t be tackled by deep learning before. Robust GNNs can function as a human brain that consists of neurons (or nerve cells), equipping machines with common sense, comprehension and cognitive capabilities. 5. New Computing Architectures Computing architecture will be restructured to meet the demands for data centers and edge computing. In the future, computing, storage and networks should meet the request of high-throughput computing for AI development, as well as the request for low power in Internet of Things scenarios. The heterogenous computing architecture with FPGA, GPU and ASIC, along with emerging memory devices, are driving the evolution of traditional computing architecture. In the foreseeable future, the fundamental changes to computing architecture, underscored by the transition from CPU-centered general computing to Domain-specific computing driven by applications and technology, will accelerate the arrival of AI and the quantum-computing era. 6. 5G Networks will Enable New Applications The fifth generation of wireless technology (5G) will see a significant increase of wireless bandwidth, enhancing the peak speed of 4G network nearly 100 times. This will speed the development of 4k/8k ultra-high-definition videos and immersive interaction based on AR/VR. With connection capability reaching billions of devices, it will enable thorough integration of communication and connection between machines. Networks will gradually evolve into the cloud or become software-based. Networks could also be segmented into multiple virtual subnets that are independent and parallel, offering dedicated virtual private networks for various applications. Additionally, with features like high reliability, low latency and large capacity, 5G networks will enable the development of new areas, such as vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems and the Industrial Internet. 7. Digital Identity Becomes a Second ID Card The expansion of biometric, anti-spoofing and liveness-detection technologies are reshaping the identify verification space. Biometric technology is becoming critical in people’s daily lives, allowing for a more simple and seamless way to confirm identities and increase trust. 8. More-Prudent Developments in Autonomous Driving Biometric technology is maturing and being applied large scale. With the wide adoption of 3D sensors and integration of multiple models of biometric features, each device will be equipped with machine intelligence to see and hear the world. Biometric and liveness detection/anti-spoofing technology is reshaping people’s identification and verification, which will make your digital identity a sort of second ID card. From phone unlock, door access control to dining at restaurants, checking out at supermarkets, entering train stations, passing airport security check and seeing doctors in hospitals, biometric technology is playing an increasingly important role in making trust simpler and our daily life better. 9. Faster Deployment of Blockchain Applications People are more rational about the prospects of blockchain, which was once much overhyped. The deployment of blockchain applications with sustainable commercial value is expected to speed up. Along with the rapid digitization of various industries, IoT technologies will underpin the trusted mapping from off-chain world into on-chain data, and blockchain will expedite the restructuring and optimization of trusted data flow across participants to boost the efficiency of workflow and coordination. More and more blockchain applications will be seen in our daily life, such as cross-border remittances, supply-chain financing, electronic invoices and tamper-proof judicial records. As the value of “chaining” becomes more recognized, layered architecture and cross-chain protocol will become the focus of technology to scale up blockchain infrastructure. 10. Data-Protection Technologies Will Thrive Governments around the world intend to enact/implement more stringent policies and regulations on data security. Corporates will need to invest more in protecting individual data privacy. Though cyberattacks won’t cease in the next few years, data-protection technologies will boom. Traceability technologies across systems, such as watermark, and data-asset protection technology, including advanced anti-crawlers against strong cyberattacks, will be more broadly adopted. ■Source:gongxiangcj■Note:Please specify the source or references of the article for reproduced.■Solemn declaration:We reproduced articles and news for purpose of sharing information.

For 2019, we’ll see an uptick in both emerging selling techniques and established technology that are must-haves for growing businesses. Here are 8 fast growing trends you should utilize asap! Mobile apps are here to stay and to continue their explosive growth. Each year we see a rise of mobile app usage. 2019 will be no different. Brands are using mobile apps to better serve customers with an undistracted shopping experience and a vehicle for sending personalized messages through push notifications. It seems to be well received. According to a report from Statista, by the year 2020, mobile apps are expected to generate $188.9 billion as global revenue. For e-commerce apps, in particular, consumers spend 8x more than on traditional selling channels. If your brand is considering a mobile app, now’s time to get on board. 1.

How Free Influencers Took My Brand To Global Success 4. The Coming Disruption to E-Commerce Search The effectiveness of video marketing is not new. However,live videohas been making waves in the world of e-commerce. The introduction of shoppable video has us prepared for a full-blown tsunami of popularity in the new year. Facebook Live, in particular,has given brands a new way to show brand personality, build true fan connection, and provide that coveted human connection. Facebook Live has given retailers a way to show up for a broad audience, increasing brand reach, engagement, and overall sales. How can you make your live video shoppable? Cue comment selling. Comment Selling is not new, but it is a young and budding trend. Brands have already seen the necessity and value of having a social media presence. However, they may not have seen the burgeoning opportunity of monetizing their social media following. Comment selling marries social media and e-commerce by allowing customers to purchase directly through comment claims on Facebook and Instagram. Comment selling possesses an undeniable appeal with its power to drive peer to peer marketing, cultivate brand loyalty, and attract new customers quickly and effortlessly. Businesses of all sizes can use comment selling to bolster sales and drive customer engagement. To make it really work for scaling businesses, it helps to implement tools that will automatically send invoices straight to your customer’s inbox or messenger as soon as a comment claim is made. Modern customers make purchasing decisions over multiple touchpoints — online, offline, via mobile and on social channels. Businesses using 4 or more digital channels will outperform those using single or dual channels by 300%. However, businesses need a way to connect all these channels to a single hub for easier management and better customer experiences. Basically,one tool to handle them all. According to a survey by Boston Retail Partners, 81% of retailers will deploy a unified commerce platform to support commerce through all channels by the end of 2020. Expect to see a rise in these platforms and strong unions between social media selling, webstores, mobile app, and brick & mortar in 2019. Brick-and-Click is a business model in which a has both a physical and online presence with blending of the two through a number of engaging personalized tools and services. This method also utilizes a single inventory so there can be a smooth transition between both brick & mortar and online channels without overselling. Automation has already started making profound impacts on the business world and we see no end to its rise in popularity. A study bySupply Managementstated that by 2019, 72% of enterprises would be using automation to reduce costs, improve productivity, increase compliance, and shorten transaction times. Automation can manage a multitude of tasks such as invoicing, re-targeting ads, marketing emails, and much more on autopilot. Not only does this lend to labor cost savings, but it also gives rise to improvements in productivity and accuracy. With automation freeing up business owners, they can invest more of their time in business strategy or simply have the ability to get their nights and weekends back. Do it all with one, simple tool.

Proscribed by my ethnicity from ever running on time, I just finally got around to putting up my new calendar. Anyway, here’s Your Humble Correspondent’s forecast for the next 363 days in all things blockchain-adjacent. For the record, this isn’t the calendar I just hanged on my fridge. 1902 Justus van Lieberg Trade Card Calendar front. Source: David Berry. When other investments turn sour, crypto will taste sweeter and sweeter.You heard a lot about the stock market’s losing year, but it was really just a regression to the mean after 2017’s profit party. So I think the indices will track upward this year — slowly, measuredly upward. Stocks will be boring. Bonds might be more interesting, but that’s not a compliment. As yield curves flatten and perhaps invert, there’ll be a disincentive to fund long-term projects, which is economic kryptonite.Prediction: Money will flow into crypto as a hedge on the bigger money that flows into cash. Vocabulary will improve.Malta’s regulators distinguish between cryptocurrencies, security tokens and utility tokens. Other regulators will catch up. And the industry will then catch up to the regulators because what gets measured gets done.Everyone will be scrupulous to define what it is they’re trying to do with their ICO or STO. Regulation will move forward, but un-regulation will move forwarder.Sovereign governments would be committing malpractice if they didn’t monitor the crypto space for KYC, AML, ATF and (especially) tax evasion concerns. So exchanges like Coinbase, which scrupulously adhere to all these standards, will continue to thrive by being a safe haven for institutional investors and other solid citizens who want to be — or at least appear — completely aboveboard with their crypto transactions. But let’s remember that “crypto” means “hidden,” and it was the whole Austrian-school, libertarian, borderline anarchical sentiment that fueled its adoption. Some people will still want to buy heroin straight from the poppy farmer. Others will want to transfer money to family in countries that don’t play nice with others. And still others will say it’s none of anyone’s goddamn business what I do with my money — it’smymoney. For them, decentralized exchanges which offer enhanced privacy at the risk of running afoul of regulators will grow vigorously in offshore havens.Those who want to demonstrate compliance will, but those who don’t won’t. Putting paid to credit cards.Visa, MasterCard and American Express aren’t going anywhere, but they’re in for some competition via blockchain. Decentralized credit will emerge as a major use case for the technology. This will lower the cost per transaction at just the time when Lightning Network improves bandwidth enough to handle all the processing required.Credit card issuers won’t be measurably hurt by blockchain workarounds in the short term, but they will have to respond somehow. Money will relocate.It’s getting harder to make a living in financial services in London or Zurich. This isn’t just a cryptocurrency issue, although British and Swiss regulatory missteps and political ill will have been revealed in this space more starkly than elsewhere.Such digital asset-friendly venues as Malta, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are likely to benefit from Old Money enclaves’ inability to keep up. Technology remains unpredictable.So I won’t attempt to predict it. What I’m confident in, though, is this:Blockchain will converge with gaming, machine learning and virtual/augmented reality to provide offerings by the end of the year that are unforeseeable at the beginning; meanwhile, the energy requirements of mining will spur improvements in efficiency and renewable sourcing. China has been sandbagging all this time, and that’s about to end.China will finally put an end to the charade that it has any reservations about crypto. Beijing would’ve ideally liked to keep the game going for a while longer, but the trade war — which it’s losing (I’m no Trump partisan, but a fact’s a fact) — is forcing its hand.By the end of the year, China will have legal centralized exchanges, tolerated offshore exchanges, more DLT patents than any other country, blockchain integrated into its currently sketchy and inefficient debt market, crypto pay options on all its leading e-commerce sites and maybe-just-maybe its own central bank digital currency (possibly developed by GXChain). Feel free to have a laugh at all this a year from now, but be sure to give me a couple days’ grace time.",William Freedman,https://medium.com/@WilliamFreedman?source=post_page---byline--67959c1cb740---------------------------------------,5,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg,2019-01-02T18:53:02.396Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@ConnorTheMiller/curation-as-art-9de0ae562eab?source=tag_archive---------80-----------------------,Curation as Art,Written byConnor Miller,"Connor Miller Follow -- Listen Share The purpose of a librarian is to help the reader navigate overwhelm. The library is a huge place, that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian, familiar with the rules, listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section, author, or title. On the internet, we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter, the rules change, the platforms change, and it can be difficult to find real news, useful information, or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate, I find we need guides, similar to librarians, who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need. The first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements, and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations, since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian, then, is our community. Every day I am on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, scrolling through a sea of content, liking, following, and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this, your friends to this, and anyone online does a version of this, making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste, which makes each collection of online content singular and special. For example, I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook, which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes, and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares, and even though he is not producing original content, the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages, or a scrapbook collection. Oscar’s product is his taste, which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation, I started a project called “CultureBucket”, in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can readhere. There are other folks as well who have really leaned in to the curation game. My favorite is Maria Popova, creator of Brainpickings (link). Self-described as a “curator of interestingness”, Popova reads a massive amount of books weekly, and shares excerpts of her favorites online. Many of the books she picks can be found at your local library. She will sometimes review bestsellers, but she also manages to bring in older books and authors that have insight that is still relevant today. On the topics of love, creativity, and living well, I find myself constantly coming back to Brainpickings for Popova’s exceptional taste. So, by taking note of how both Oscar and Popova manage to drive interest simply through sharing their collections, I think that we all can become conscious curators. Futhermore, I think knowing that curation is an art can help us find good accounts to follow as well. I find Joi Ito to be my favorite online curator. He has a podcast series in which he interviews his friends and colleagues in a informal manner, discussing extremely relevant and technical problems that we face today. Most recently I find myself re-listening to his conversation with Virginia Heffernan (link) in which they talk about how language and the internet influence each other. These conversations often serve as leads for other topics I am interested in. I am currently reading two books, each written by different folks Joi Ito has interviewed. I believe it is a meaningful pursuit to be a conscious curator of your own feed, and to pursue others who also are aware of the content that they are consuming and sharing.

https://medium.com/datacrat/metadata-management-d396cb88012?source=tag_archive---------81-----------------------,metadata management,Published inDatacrat,"Janhavie Follow Datacrat -- Listen Share According to a report published by IDC “Metadata is one of the fastest-growing sub-segments of enterprise data management.” Metadata is central component to the success of many of data management practices such as Data Governance, Master Data Management, Business Intelligence and Analytics, and other related activities in a data-driven enterprise. Data-driven enterprises are using data to generate new competitive advantage by systematically observing and analysing data. The role of metadata has become more pivotal than ever before. What is Metadata ? The most cliched and the simplest definition of metadata so far has been “Data about data”. With growing importance of data as strategic asset and trend of Data Driven Decision Making(DDDM) the definition have acquired a whole new meaning to it. The new-age definition by Gartner — Metadata is information regarding the characteristics of any artifact, such as its name, location, perceived importance, quality or value to the enterprise, and its relationships to other artifacts that an enterprise has deemed worth managing. Types of Metadata —Mostly metadata is categorised under 3 types - Descriptive metadata— Information about the intellectual content and physical format. Supports discovery, identification, and selection. Structural metadata— Information that describes the structure of the different data objects, navigation and presentation of the data to the user. Administrative metadata— provides information to manage a resource from administration point of view. Two subcategories of this metadata areRights management metadata and preservation metadata I much prefer the Business Intelligence broad categorisation into 2 over the above mentioned 3 types - Business Metadata— Business Metadata describes the business definitions, rules, regulations and data context and data quality expectations Technical Metadata— Technical Metadata describes the physical structure, interfaces, format, and rules for storing data. Documentation for auditing derivations, dependencies, and data flow. And data represents actual instances. A very basic and not so fancy example below - What Is Metadata Management ? Metadata helps in understanding the data and metadata management helps in use of that metadata. Metadata management encompasses all the activities associated with metadata around creation, storage and control. Creation— Capturing metadata at the point of object creation is critical. Huge archives of data exist in most enterprises. Yet finding a specific data object or a content-based requirement across multiple objects is challenging. Storage— Storing metadata in a common repository enhances its usability. Logical centralisation (The ability to view and share resources or metadata across applications) of metadata over physical centralisation. Control— Controlling inconsistencies and redundancies in metadata. This control activity describes the taxonomy/classification/metadata relationship required for effective data asset management. The goals of metadata management are To promote metadata conformity to enable sharing of metadata by all applications. Metadata that is defined for one application can be copied and easily used by another application. To provide a common, centralised method of searching and managing distinct collections of metadata. Metadata Management is intricately interlaced with data governance. Data governance incorporates and supervises all metadata management aspects and capabilities.",Janhavie,https://medium.com/@janhavie?source=post_page---byline--d396cb88012---------------------------------------,0,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*2t1IxApCH5tpcKdqKHhZgw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*n7OBPwpbnaYjerCWDgpxnA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*n7OBPwpbnaYjerCWDgpxnA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*n7OBPwpbnaYjerCWDgpxnA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*2t1IxApCH5tpcKdqKHhZgw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*2t1IxApCH5tpcKdqKHhZgw.jpeg,2019-01-01T07:16:55.642Z,Medium

It hasn’t been the easiest year for crypto — markets tumbled, sentiment slowed down, regulations tightened and the exuberance that characterized the market at the end of last year gradually transformed into a state of skepticism and reevaluation. A tough but necessary process, which is typical for every market cycle and amplified in crypto. We are going through a paradigm shift that is preparing the industry for healthier growth and more logical and structured valuation systems. In 2018 we have laid down the foundation for the days ahead. We released the early version of the APEX mobile wallet with multi-currency functionality, and at the end of November we released Phase One of the APEX Blockchain Testnet, all of which is according to our short and long-term technology development plan. Equally important is our expansion of the team and talent, which has surpassed even our own expectations and has outgrown the Microsoft offices into our own 200+ employee office. Lastly, we were through numerous awards recognized by a large number of organizations including Red Herring for our technological innovations, current success, robustness and future potential.We leave a bearish year behind where numerous blockchain projects have found themselves struggling financially. However, we can confidently say that we have the runway and capital for continuing to develop APEX Network into the leading Blockchain technology, and to drive adoption in the enterprise ecosystem. We aim to create valuable and innovative use cases surrounding consumer data privacy, decentralized storage, and in general further use cases in “Data+AI+Blockchain”. We expect 2019 to bring us both joy and challenges. The rollout of testnet phase 2, which includes a Virtual Machine, is expected soon. Mainnet will follow in the months after. Thank you for your continued support, and best wishes for the New Year!

https://medium.com/@salmanmiah/comparison-of-pow-pos-and-dpos-governance-models-dcea481140f8?source=tag_archive---------49-----------------------,"Comparison of PoW, PoS And DPoS Governance Models","Decentralization involves systems that require governance models or consensus mechanisms as they are popularly known. There are a number of these governance models, each with advantages and disadvantages and some being more practical than others.","Decentralization involves systems that require governance models or consensus mechanisms as they are popularly known. There are a number of these governance models, each with advantages and disadvantages and some being more practical than others. Sal Miah Follow -- Listen Share These governance models weigh heavily as some of the most critical factors of a platform such as latency and throughput — some of the most popular governance models that every blockchain enthusiast will have heard of include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). These are the most widely used consensus algorithms in the blockchain space. This article pitches the three governance models against each other to give the reader a clear view of how these governance models compare. The concept for the Proof of Work governance model was presented in 1993 before the term ‘Proof of Work’ was coined in 1999 by Marcus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. The core reason for applying the PoW model is to deter denial-of-service attacks by requiring requesters of a particular service to do work, and in blockchain’s case, computational work, before a block is submitted. Many platforms have employed this consensus such that for one to mine a particular digital currency, they have to spend computational energy. Miners have to solve complex mathematical problems that require much energy. The first miner to solve the problem receives handsome rewards regarding the digital currency of that particular platform. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s case. ➡️Proof of Work also solves the problem of double spending in cryptocurrency. The more extensive the network, the harder it is for an individual to execute double spending because of the computational energy required to control the network. The kind of energy necessary to influence transactions in bitcoin is enough to power approximately 15 households in America; this is according todigiconomist.Herein lies a significant problem with PoW. The world is trying to go green by consuming less energy and coming up with more ways to produce green energy. The computational power required for the mining activities taking place around the world is enormous. This is against what the world is aiming for regarding energy consumption. ➡️Proof of Work’s other drawback is seen in its latency and throughput figure. They are low with platforms such as Ethereum only managing to hit a peak of 15TPS which is poor compared to the demand that the network experiences. This brings us to the alternative governance model that many developers have been using, the Proof of Stake mechanism. Proof of Stakehas been the more logical option for those who want to avoid the drawbacks of PoW. Proof of Stake works similarly to PoW. However, the difference in these two consensus methods is that PoS requires the miner to own/hold/have digital currency. The amount of cryptocurrency of a particular platform owned is an indication of the stake a miner has for that specific platform. ➡️The workings of the PoS consensus mechanism are two-fold. The first method is by placing a high requirement for conducting an attack on the network. Fifty-one percent of all cryptocurrencies in that network will be required to initiate an attack. Due to most set up on these platforms, it is difficult for one source to have such a huge percentage. This, therefore, bars the greater population from initiating such an attack. ➡️The second way is through lowering the incentive for conducting the attack. If a miner is determined to attack by acquiring the required amount of cryptocurrency, then they would be attacking themselves indirectly. By holding such a vast number of cryptocurrencies, if the platform takes a hit and it affects the value of these digital coins, then the attacker also losses a similar percentage value. This mechanism discourages attackers by ensuring that there is no reward in attacking the platform. More blockchain enthusiasts are inclined to PoS as it favors the majority compared to PoW. An excellent example of why PoS is preferred is Bitcoin. Now, Bitcoin uses PoW. Miners usually have to look for powerful equipment which is very expensive to mine. Comparing that to any platform that uses PoS, what their miners require is just ownership of some digital currency and internet connection via available devices. Proof of Stake is not perfect in itself. It has certain drawbacks that can easily be exploited. It depends on the owners of large percentages of cryptocurrencies to push the platform and the cryptocurrency in the right direction. A generous nature of a vast majority is highly unlikely, as history has taught us, therefore some miners may end up being exploited to benefit the few at the top. Hacking also affects PoS governance models more than it does PoW. When hacked, a miner loses more than just their cryptocurrency; they lose their place in the platform. They cannot participate in voting unlike in PoW where miners only lose their cryptocurrency. These drawbacks led to the development of the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) comes in as a viable solution to the problems facing both PoW and PoS. Its functions are similar to that of PoS, but it is different in that it has more democratic features when compared to PoS. It is currently the governance model that most new platforms are opting for as it provides a more wholesome approach as a governance model. ➡️In DPoS, delegated witnesses are introduced. These witnesses have the power to vote on behalf of those who have elected them. The witness functions similarly to miners in platforms using PoS. In DPoS however, the performance of the selected witnesses is scrutinized such that those who underperform or who do not represent the views of their voters can be voted out, and new witnesses voted in. ➡️Stake in the platform in DPoS is similar to PoS as stakeholders have influence proportional to the number of cryptocurrencies they own. In DPoS, the threshold to become a valid voter and contributor to the platforms is lowered to levels which favor the frequent users of these platforms. Delegated Proof of Stake introduces democracy into blockchain. It is therefore only as useful as the voters within that platform. Those who are voted as witnesses dictate the direction of the platform thereby putting pressure on voters to elect those whom they see as fit to lead them to greater heights. The success of DPoS has been seen thus far in platforms such as Steem that have become prominent worldwide. It has also helped maintain decentralization in platforms where it has been applied, and it has been instrumental in fending off regulatory interferences. Furthermore, it has dealt with the setbacks of both PoW and PoS while maintaining their strengths thus leading to more robust platforms with excellent performance. ➡️ælfis among the platforms currently utilizing DPoS. Its DPoS system is essential to its entire model and purpose. ælf’s platform is a multi-chain parallel block computing network that aims to work as an OS for blockchain. The DPoS consensus mechanism was selected as it would work best with the parallel chains that are in use in ælf. In regards to user experience, the high frequency and predictability of block information that is required in Aelf will be delivered by the robust and able DPoS system. ælf’s smooth running testnet is a testament to the success that DPoS can provide. In conclusion, DPoS is an all-around governance model. It covers most needs that many decentralized platforms, their users and their miners will appreciate.

If you’re planning on attending CES early next week let me know, I’ll be attending and would love to connect. 2018 was a big year, looking forward to an even bigger year in 2019! If you enjoyed reading this article please subscribe to my newsletter for curated opportunities and upcoming eventshere. “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” -Mark Twain Times Critics’ Top Books of 2018:Just in case you were curious what the all powerful NY Times Book Review cultural critics read and reviewed this year. With the number of voices on the Internet, and how verticals are so niche focused (and predictive analytics keep getting smarter) I don’t believe the NY Times has the cultural authority it enjoyed in the past. I read a lot of books in 2018 (and am taking a hiatus from social in the hopes of reading even more in 2019); below are a few of the books I thoroughly enjoyed and believe you will as well. *I will caveat with this, the one question I get asked frequently is how I read so much. The answer is that I make time for it, I just cut out other activities that are not as important to me. But the real answer is just consistency, everyone can start a habit by reading 10 pages a day. That’s very manageable. For all the books being published most people don’t read, which is why I think a daily reading habit is like having a superpower (I use Audible as well,but the data shows reading is still the most effective way to retain knowledge). ⚪️12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaosby Jordan Peterson:I’m perfectly aware of the controversy around Peterson and how he ispersona non gratato many on the left. I honestly don’t get it. Not an easy book to get thru but worth it; the author (along with authors like Ryan Holiday and Sam Harris) is the closest thing we have to a modern day philosopher. HisYouTube channelis an accessible way to learn about his philosophies. ⚪️21 Lessons for the 21st Centuryby Yuval Noah Harari:No surprise I would include this book. WhileSapiensstill stands out as YNH’s best work this a good guide for where we are today (and could be headed in the near future). I also felt that this was the author’s coming out book, where he displayed openly himself (and his political leanings). He’s still one of my favorite authors and I’m curious to see where he goes next. ⚪️Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolationby Dan Schawbel:Another pick that should not be surprising given that the ability to connect with people by understanding their perspective (aka empathy) is at an all time low (particularly because of technology). We need more books like this as I don’t see the current crop of people leading our world showing much empathy these days (except towards their base of supporters). This book should be on the reading list of anyone who manages an organization; whether that’s a startup or a Fortune 500. ⚪️New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World–and How to Make It Work for Youby Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms:Anyone who wants to understand our current policy reality and how we got here needs to read this book. It’s actually shocking how many arm chair political critics refuse to acknowledge some of concepts detailed in this book such as the power of decentralized (#hashtag) movements. Just the chapter on the 2016 Presidential race is worth the price of the book. ⚪️The Laws of Human Natureby Robert Greene:If Greene’s classic works like the48 Rules of Powerwere for aspiring Machiavellian wannabes this work is for those aspiring to learn the two most important skills in 2019; empathy and self-awareness (which go hand in hand). The author is able to pull lessons from history and make them relevant today in a way that presents the full range of human behaviors. The back story about how the author suffered a stroke and was able to utilize lessons (particularly the story of legendary psychiatrist Milton Erickson) from the book in his recovery shows that the proof is in the pudding. ⚪️ELLIS Accelerator:Deadline January 15. Equity-free program for international startups expanding to the US. They support startups that already have traction in their home market and are ready to expand to the United States. Perks: office space and housing in NYC, mentoring, workshops, access to an exclusive community, and a benefits package worth $350k+.Apply here. ⚪️Exceed.ai Head of Marketing:This Tel Aviv founded AI powered Sales Development Automation Platform is helping sales and marketing teams scale by automating lead capturing, nurturing, engagement and qualification. As the Head of Marketing, you will be their first full time Marketing hire and will lead all marketing activities such as build the Exceed.ai brand, tell their story globally, drive demand through content, media and other means, produce sales material and shape the strategy and direction of their company.Apply here. ⚪️FuzeHub Innovation Incentive Prize:FuzeHub will administer a New York State Innovation Incentive Prize Program for Food, Beverage & Agriculture Technologies. There are $90,000 in program funds available — with a $10,000 max award per applicant. The Innovation Incentive Prize Program will solicit proposals that support the development of innovative products and/or solutions that will lead to more efficient operations within small-scale farm businesses as well as food processing/beverage production businesses. There is no deadline to apply, but funding for the Innovation Incentive Prize Program is limited, so get there first!Apply here. ⚪️UpStart:UpStart is currently seeking bold, talented, risk-taking, and collaborative individuals to join their team of visionaries in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver-Boulder, or New York City.Learn moreabout the Innovation Lead position.Learn moreabout the Chief Development Officer position.

https://medium.com/@roy_4457/top-it-challenges-for-pharmaceutical-companies-da45e39ed7ce?source=tag_archive---------155-----------------------,Top IT Challenges for Pharmaceutical Companies,Written byRoy Strunin,"Roy Strunin Follow -- Listen Share What are the top IT challenges and possible solutions for pharmaceutical companies today? 1. Changing Regulatory Requirements Digital health care is driving many innovations across industries, especially pharma. However, companies, industries and regulators are not always in sync when it comes to developing sound compliance protocols. Automation, for example, is revolutionizing the way companies address many processes, including the documentation and reporting required for compliance. Companies need to be responsive to rapidly evolving market demands, while at the same time meeting the changing, different, and detailed regulatory requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European markets and other regions. However, for pharma companies to rely on automation and other emerging technologies, there needs to be greater confidence in core areas, including: Data integrity and validation System integration Excel and SharePoint management Data are often stored in silos and accessed via different platforms. Companies need to integrate data while maintaining integrity. Low confidence in data accuracy can cast doubt on internal researchers and regulators, prompting the need for better data analytics tools. Automation solutions allow pharma companies to reduce the costs of data management, improve data quality and add operational value. Those improvements allow companies to get treatments to market faster while ensuring no harm to patients. 2. Complex Supply Chains Supply chains are integral to pharma success, whether in pharma R&D or manufacturing. A complex network of suppliers, vendors and partners need to communicate, collaborate and share information in real time. Transparency and speed are critical. That means having the right solutions in place for data sharing, communication, document management and collaboration. In addition, sourcing and validation are vital, however, to keeping illegal, tainted, counterfeit and stolen substances out of the supply chain. The U.S. Congress adopted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCMA) in 2013 to address these concerns. These traceability requirements for prescription drugs have affected manufacturers, distributors, repackagers and dispensers. These requirements have forced manufacturers to have tools that allow for greater transparency throughout the supply chain. Dispensers, for example, cannot accept product ownership without a full transactional history. Standardization and streamlining efforts have helped the industry, but technical solutions are still necessary to make sure compliance for the entire supply chain. 3. Cybersecurity Intellectual property (IP) is a core asset for pharma companies. Protecting these IP assets is critical and often rely on securing a company’s data. With the growth of cyberattacks, companies need broad and deep protection at every level. Addressing the range of cybersecurity threats — malware, ransomware, phishing and viruses — means equipping companies with multiple defenses. At the network perimeter, next-generation firewalls are needed to monitor potential intrusions and suspicious behavior. Throughout the infrastructure, changes need to be tracked and anomalies alerted to security personnel. At the device level, desktop computers and mobile computers need powerful anti-malware protection that is automatically updated and constantly monitoring. To address their critical IT needs, pharma companies need a proven partner with industry-specific experience.

https://medium.com/@julian_74855/the-r-evolution-of-music-experiences-ff23d0d1aea0?source=tag_archive---------156-----------------------,The (r)Evolution of Music Experiences,Written byJulian Keaton,"Julian Keaton Follow -- Listen Share The first time I recorded music, it was in a dingy basement were we didn’t know multi-track recording existed. The stereo playing the beat laid on the bed next to the mic stand and I remember freestyling about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It was 2006 and the business of music was entirely different. Limewire was still the beast it was and I spent most of my middle school days online sharing my music on Bebo & Myspace with SoundClick players and YouTube videos. Feel old yet or were you even around then? Today’s climate of distribution and consumption has evolved well beyond pirating music via torrent software. Much like the transitions from cassette to CD, CD to mp3 and now mp3 to streaming, we are currently living in the next transition, immersive technology and decentralized music blockchain platforms. But what doest that mean and how can the industry, the artists and the various stakeholders stay ahead of the curve? By 2021, virtual & augmented reality, cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology is expected to make waves into the mainstream. A treasured experience of traveling to a record store and playing that brand new CD in your car will change to paying musicians in crypto and receiving access to a virtual reality album release party. Every time a transition occurs as a byproduct of technology, the industry can’t keep up and a window opens for artists to take back more control. And as technology becomes readily accessible to consumers and market developers, the idea of independents disrupting is a greater possibility. But with anything, a financial investment is required to convert noise into purposeful attention. But this is were the new artist development walks in. As the industry adapts to the changes of technology, artists have the greatest opportunity to retain ownership and rights in how their intellectual property is exploited. Gone are the days of middlemen controlling the logistics of how your works can be distributed and consumed. We live in an era were creatives get to explore, innovate and add their contribution to culture. Musicians have the ability to segment current and potential fans and tailor experiences for those segmented audiences. Whether you have the infrastructure to take your music to the world or create a hyperlocal experience for your die hard fans, it’s time to get the most creative.

https://medium.com/sea-foam-media/my-anti-moon-comment-was-deleted-4642b659c696?source=tag_archive---------84-----------------------,My anti-moon comment was deleted,Published inSea Foam Media,"Rhiannon Payne Follow Sea Foam Media -- 12 Listen Share Last week I replied to what was a rather ridiculous LinkedIn post about the Bitcoin market, with a well-reasoned response against the alleged “moon” coming — which was immediately deleted by the poster. I’m a huge proponent of the potential of blockchain technology (obviously). I’m also intrigued by blockchain’s ability to revolutionize fundraising through STOs, even for projects that don’t utilize blockchain or token economies. However, I am not a traditional crypto investor. I pulled my ETH out in June at a break-even point and I sleep better at night because of it. It seems like the only people still predicting another sky-rocket in the value of BTC are those deeply invested in the market and currently underwater. But to me, the “moon” makes zero sense, for a variety of reasons. And posts like the one I saw last week, whose author deleted my comment, seem deeply misguided and even irresponsible. We should all know that there are no such things as get-rich-quick schemes.I believe that the extreme growth of BTC last year was a flash in the pan, and that people’s “lambo” attitudes today are detrimental to the community as a whole. Let’s consider the original purpose and ethos surrounding Bitcoin — a decentralized currency to give control back to the people, with no influence from major institutions, to eventually replace the USD. For this to happen, it doesn’t matter if BTC sits at $1M or $1. It just has to be STABLE. For it to work, there can’t be the risk of it dropping by 5%, 10%, 20%+ in a week. No one’s going to hang on to it to use in practical situations. The only people with BTC will be those who want to pump and dump it or HODL (lol). If people aren’t using BTC practically then what, exactly, is the point? As the market deteriorates, one thing I keep hearing is “The institutional investors are finally coming! Now that we’ve bottomed, it’s time to moon!!” This is apparently something people have heard from “financial analysts” and “asset managers.” But here we are, at the crux of the problem — BTC has become yet another currency that’s influenced by the rich, more-so than USD. If a “whale” invests a quarter-billion in BTC and the price “moons,” how is that giving control back to the people?At this point, all arguments I’m seeing for the growth in value of BTC literally hinge on market manipulation. And yes, regulations are coming — but that’s not necessarily going to impact BTC, which the SEC has already determined to be “sufficiently decentralized.” And when people say that more institutional investors are ready to come in at long last, that’s the exact opposite of what I have heard from such investors, who are now eyeing stable, regulatedSTOsas the real opportunity. The idea of tokenizing a security like equity, with real-world drivers behind the tokens like a company’s growth, is amazing. Real estate is another great use case for security tokens, making high-end real estate investments accessible to a larger pool of investors. I’ve also spoken to credible securities lawyers who see a possible future where all stocks and bonds trade on blockchain. This is fascinating and exciting stuff. I’m not saying now is or isn’t a good time for investors to buy. Heck, I don’t know, it probably is.(*I am not a financial advisor)So if you want to pump and dump and HODL, your call — but that’s not helping BTC and the crypto community, just creating an environment that’s increasingly unsustainable. And if this offends you so much that you want to delete my comment, I think that only adds to the validity of what I’m saying. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, let’s keep innovating, finding real use cases, and exploring ways to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public, even if it’s not BTC. I truly believe that blockchain and a universal cryptocurrency has the ability to unite us and create a more equitable world. It’s already having a profound impact onemerging and unstable economies. I also see it bringing niche communities of people together.Thisis the stuff that excites me! Not day trading to make a quick buck. If you have a different opinion, please share. I’m not a trading expert, just a blockchain agency owner and enthusiast. I am very open to hearing different perspectives and ideas. Edit: I’ve had this post sitting here in my drafts, waiting to be published, for a few weeks now. Are we closer to the moon yet? I guess the new year will tell.

https://medium.com/@jeffderrick/an-argument-for-staying-put-why-job-hopping-isnt-always-the-answer-baf48c999a69?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,An Argument for Staying Put — Why Job Hopping Isn’t Always the Answer,The Downside of Pursuing Fulfillment?,"Jeff Derrick Follow -- Listen Share I’m a bit of an oddball in the tech world in that I’ve worked at the same institution for over 12 years. When I meet fellow techies for the first time and tell them this, for example at a conference, I’ll often get a surprised reaction. There’s a positive reaction at the surface (“oh, that’s great”), but also a look that conveys an underlying confusion, and perhaps even concern. If put into words, it might sound something like: “How can you stay innovative and move forward in your career if you stay at the same place for more than a few years?” Or if put into more negative terms: “You must not really care that much about your career to stick in one place that long. I’m not sure I have too much in common with you.” Take this brief exchange in the movieOffice Space, between the main character Peter who’s become disenchanted with his career, and his friend Samir who’s more in the ‘just happy to have a job’ state of mind: Peter: What if we’re still doing this when we’re fifty?Samir: It would be nice to have that kind of job security. Peter: What if we’re still doing this when we’re fifty? Samir: It would be nice to have that kind of job security. I’ve always loved Office Space, it’s humor gets at the absurdities of corporate tech jobs in a way that I haven’t come across since, plus just hilarious. But as all good comedies always do, it also points to deep and more profound questions… This exchange in particular gets at a tension in most of us, the ‘safe play’ vs the ‘fulfilling and exciting’. As the audience, we mostly identify with Peter, at how depressing it would be to stick around the same company for that long (particularly one as awful as the company that they work for, Initec). But if we dwell on this a bit more, I think most of us also identify just a bit with Samir. Does he actually have a point? I think this tension is even more of an issue in the modern/western world than it has been in the past. For those of us lucky enough to be able to take the basic life necessities for granted (food, water, shelter, clothing, etc.) we’re often thinking less about how to keep and hold onto a stable job that will supply our basic needs, and are focusing more on whether or not we’re fulfilled in our careers. This dynamic is particularly strong in the tech world. Generally speaking there are plenty of jobs that will pay the bills, and the demand for programmers just seems to be growing, which puts more and more of the power into the hands of the employee tochoosea job that is fulfilling, not just whatever they can get to pay the bills. The Downside of Pursuing Fulfillment? Of course, there’s nothing wrong with pursuing fulfilling work, on the contrary I feel very lucky to live in a time and to work in a field where job fulfillment can be a major factor in choosing where I work. But I think it would be a mistake to ignore the ramifications of having these choices, or to assume that there aren’t ways in which living in a culture where job fulfillment becomes the main goal can, somewhat counterintuitively, lead to us feelinglessfulfilled in our jobs and careers. In his bookDavid and Goliath, Malcom Gladwell discusses something called “relative deprivation”: Stouffer’s point is that we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest possible context, but locally — by comparing ourselves to people “in the same boat as ourselves.” Our sense of how deprived we are is relative. This is one of those observations that is both obvious and (upon exploration) deeply profound, and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations. Which do you think, for example, has a higher suicide rate: countries whose citizens declare themselves to be very happy, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada? or countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose citizens describe themselves as not very happy at all? Answer: the so-called happy countries… If you are depressed in a place where most people are pretty unhappy, you compare yourself to those around you and you don’t feel all that bad. But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face? Stouffer’s point is that we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest possible context, but locally — by comparing ourselves to people “in the same boat as ourselves.” Our sense of how deprived we are is relative.

But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face? A key point here is that when we’re evaluating fulfillment, we can’t ignore the values of the cultures that we’re a part of, what effects they might have on us, and that we will ultimately measure ourselves against others in our community and how fulfilled we perceivethemto be. If everyone around you is moving around looking for that ever elusive perfect job, it’s natural to look around and compare yourself to them, and to worry that you’re falling behind. Think for Yourself — Even if Your Conclusion is ‘Old-Fashioned’ As with some many things, the first step to dealing with challenges like this it recognize that it exists and to acknowledge that cultures form their own values, and that those values aren’t always logical or what they’re cracked up to be. Even if the culture’s values do make sense for many people, that doesn’t mean that their values are what’s right for you. You should also recognize that you’re inevitably going to compare yourself to others, and some of the metrics that you’ll use for comparison will come from the cultures values, not necessarily what you value. In my next post, I’ll be writing about Hype & Innovation vs. Practicality in the tech world, and I’d imagine my conclusion will be much the same as it is here, the key is to think for yourself. But with a culture as strong as today’s tech world, that’s easier said than done. There are many so ideologues out there who will think you’re a dinosaur if you stay at an institution too long, or if you’re using framework X over framework Y.(or [gasp!] no framework at all!!!) The Case for Employee Retention There’s no doubt that job hopping is a good and sometimes necessary way to move forward in your career. Often leaving your job and moving somewhere else is the only way to get into a new field or to increase your salary to what you deserve. However, I tend to think of job hopping in this way as a ‘necessary evil’, a symptom that employers are not properly valuing their employees, or engaging with the true cost associated with on-boarding new employees. In my experience, there are few things more costly than having to replace a good employee. This really hit me during a recent hiring process, where I started to realize that how long someone might be interested in staying in the job might actually be one of the most important criteria to think about when evaluating candidates. Programmers arenotplug-and-play, it’s become far less important to me that a new hire knows a specific technology. For a strong candidate, the most important criteria usually comes down to: “Are they good at teaching themselves new things?” (b/c there arealwaysnew things to learn) and “Will they be happy here?” (if they are, they’ll do good work, and if they aren’t, they’ll leave for another job, and that’s expensive) InIt Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at WorkJason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, talk about their experience at Basecamp: At the time of publication of this book, a notch over 50 percent of our employees have been here for five years or more. That’s rarefied air in an industry where the average tenure at the top tech companies is less than two years.…Hiring and training people is not only expensive, but draining. All that energy could go into making better products with people you’ve kept happy for the long term by being fair and transparent about salary and benefits. Churning through people because you’re trying to suppress the wages of those who stay just seems like poor business.There’s a fountain of happiness and productivity in working with a stable crew… We’re baffled that such a competitive advantage isn’t more diligently sought. At the time of publication of this book, a notch over 50 percent of our employees have been here for five years or more. That’s rarefied air in an industry where the average tenure at the top tech companies is less than two years.…Hiring and training people is not only expensive, but draining.

There’s a fountain of happiness and productivity in working with a stable crew… We’re baffled that such a competitive advantage isn’t more diligently sought. So, job hopping isn’t great for employers. But what about employees? Why I Stayed Put The reason that I’ve stayed where I have for over 12 years is that it’s a great fit for me. My job has allowed me to develop skills in every layer of the stack, from database design, networking configuration, web server management, API development, font-end development, app development, systems integration, reporting… the list goes on and on. And contrary to what you might think, I’d argue that I would never have developed as many of these skills or developed them as deeply if I’d worked at 4–5 different places over this time period. The key for me was to stay put (and of course to work at a great place that values learning new things). All that time I might have spent in transition I was instead able to apply to learning technologies, both more deeply and more widely. And the most innovative and transformative things that I’ve accomplished were not things that I wastoldto do, they were areas where I had seen the same issues come up time and time again, and armed with my deep knowledge of the institution I was able to propose the right solutions that were often against conventional wisdom or the industry standard. These are things that I would have never been able to accomplish without the years of trust that had built up, or my detailed understanding of how the institution worked. So the next time you get that sinking feeling like you’re ‘falling behind’ for some reason, remember that the tech world is a bit of an anomaly, it’s always changing, is relatively young, and it doesn’t always have everything right. For me the right choice was to stay at my job and move forward in my career in-house, but maybe youdoneed to change jobs, maybe youshouldlearn that new technology (you should never stop learning!). But whatever the decision, remember that youcancome to a different conclusion than the conventional wisdom, in fact that might actually mean you’re on to something great.",Jeff Derrick,https://medium.com/@jeffderrick?source=post_page---byline--baf48c999a69---------------------------------------,92,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg,2024-08-05T02:52:09.376Z,Medium
https://medium.com/free-code-camp/part-1-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-4-562b1d231e75?source=tag_archive---------85-----------------------,How to Create a React app from scratch using Webpack 4,Making CSS modular,"linhothy Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 91 Listen Share For the past three weeks, I have been trying to create a React app from scratch to understand the set-up with Webpack. My aim was to set up a simple configuration which can then be grown upon. It’s been a struggle to understand Webpack. But thanks to thistutorialbyValentino Gagliardi,I’m much enlightened. What I’m planning to do is to make a search functionality with some fake JSON data (or real). In this blog post, I will go through the set up of my project. In the next one, I am planning to show how to set up testing. I would also like to add a server to this using Node.js, but not sure if the scope of my project would need that. (Note: I have provided my Webpack setup at the end of this blog post) Without further ado, let’s get on with the set up! Make anew projectandcdinto it: Create apackage.jsonfile: If you want to skip all the questions, add the -y flag: We need to installwebpackas a dev dependency andwebpack-cliso that you can use webpack in the command line: i: install -D: — save-dev Create asrc folderwithindex.jsand place the following code as an example: Now add the following scripts to your package.json (in bold): Webpack 4 now has two modes,developmentandproductionwhere code is minimised in the latter. See it for yourself by running: This will create adistfolder withmain.jsfile inside (containing your src code). If you now run: The following output is now like this: To work with React, we need to install it along with Babel. This will transpile the code from ES6 to ES5, as not all browsers support ES6 yet (for example Internet Explorer). Installreactandreact-domas a dependency -S: — save Then installbabel-core,babel-loader,babel-preset-envandbabel-preset-reactas a dev dependency: babel-core: Transforms your ES6 code into ES5 babel-loader: Webpack helper to transform your JavaScript dependencies (for example, when you import your components into other components) with Babel babel-preset-env: Determines which transformations/plugins to use and polyfills (provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it) based on the browser matrix you want to support babel-preset-react: Babel preset for all React plugins, for example turning JSX into functions We need to create awebpack.config.jsfile to state the rules for our babel-loader. We then need to make a separate file called.babelrcto provide the options for babel-loader. You can include it in the webpack.config.js file, but I have seen that most projects have this separated. This results in clearer readability, and it can be used by other tools unrelated to webpack. When you state that you’re using babel-loader in your webpack config, it will look for .babelrc file if there is one. Next, change yourindex.jsfile to render a component: We will also need to create anindex.htmlfile in thesrcfolder where we can add our section element with idindex. This is where we render our main react component: Now we need to installhtml-webpack-pluginand use this in our webpack config file. This plugin generates an HTML file with <script> injected, writes this todist/index.html,and minifies the file. Installhtml-webpack-pluginas a dev dependency: Update the webpack config like so: You can also input the plugin like this: But I prefer to extract this into a variable so I can see the list of plugins I am using. The value I am giving thetemplatekey is where I am looking for my HTML file. The filename value is the name of the minified HTML that will be generated in the dist folder. If you now runnpm run startyou should seeindex.htmlbeing generated in the dist folder. Runopen dist/index.htmland you should see “Hello React” in your browser. It is a bit tedious to keep running this command every time you want to see your changes in the browser. To have webpack “watch” our changes and thus refresh whenever we have made changes to any of our components, we can usewebpack-dev-servermodule. Go ahead and install this as a dev dependency Then change your package.json start scripts like so (in bold): If you now runnpm run startyou should seelocalhost:8080open up in your default browser — that’s what the—-openflag is for. Now everytime you make changes, it will refresh the page. You can also add a--hotflag to your npm start script which will allow you to only reload the component that you’ve changed instead of doing a full page reload. This isHot Module Replacement. The last part involves setting up our CSS. As we will be importing CSS files into our React components, we needcss-loadermodule to resolve them. Once that’s resolved, we also need astyle-loaderto inject this into our DOM — adding a <style> tag into the <head> element of our HTML. Go ahead and install both of these modules as a dev dependency: We then need to update our webpack.config.js file like so: Note that the order of adding these loaders is important. First, we need to resolve the CSS files before adding them to the DOM with the style-loader. By default, webpack uses the loaders from the right (last element in the array) to the left (first element in the array). Making CSS modular We can also make CSS modular using webpack. This means class name will be scoped locally and specific to only the component in question. To do this, we can provide some options to css-loader: As we need to give options, each loader is now an object with a key-value pair. To enable CSS modules, we need to setmoduleoption for css-loader to betrue. TheimportLoadersoption configures how many loaders before css-loader should be applied. For example, sass-loader would have to come before css-loader. ThelocalIdentNameallows you to configure the generated identification. [name]will take the name of your component [local]is the name of your class/id [hash:base64]is the randomly generated hash which will be unique in every component’s CSS To make this a bit more visual, I’ll give you an example. Say I have a component namedFormand I have a button with a CSS classprimaryButton. I also have another component calledSearchand a button in it with a CSS classprimaryButton. However, both of these classes have different CSS: When webpack bundles your application, depending on which CSS comes latest, both of your buttons could have the color green or blue instead of Form having green and Search having blue. This is where the localIdentName comes into place. With this, once your application is bundled, your buttons will have a unique class name! As you can see, the button class name in the Form component is different to the one in the Search component — their naming starts with the name of the component, class name, and unique hash code. So with this, you won’t have to worry about whether you have given the same class name throughout your whole application — you only have to worry about whether you have used it in the same component. This concludes the first part of setting a React app from scratch. In the next blog post, I aim to explain how to set up tests for TDD and how to write them. Please let me know if something is unclear and I’ll explain the best as I can. I value and welcome constructive feedback as this helps me to improve :) Hope this helps! Importing CSS I’ve had a few comments asking me how they can render CSS which I didn’t touch on previously. What you need to do is import the CSS file in your React component. For example, say you have a Search component and this is your tree directory: You will need to import your CSS file in your Search component like so: You can then apply different CSS class styles such as: You don’t have to call it style but what I found is that most people have given it this name in their projects. My Webpack boilerplate For anyone who wants a quick clone of this Webpack setup, I have this on myGitHub. I’ve also included a more succinct guide in the README. Entry and output points Webpack 4 by default has a default entry point ofindex.jsin yoursrcfolder. If you would like to point to a different file, you can do so by specifying an entry point in your webpack config file: e.g. You can also specify output file like so: Thanks toGudu Kassafor pointing this out!

https://medium.com/@Pozess/a-brief-history-on-the-evolution-of-e-commerce-85239bfafd28?source=tag_archive---------139-----------------------,A Brief History On The Evolution of E-Commerce,Written byPozess,"Pozess Follow -- Listen Share The ‘90s-early ’00s In August 1994, 21-year-old entrepreneur and creator of NetMarket, Dan Kohn, sold a CD to a friend who lived hundreds of miles away. This was a revolutionary moment in the history of ecommerce, as it came to be known as the first purchase made over the internet and the first purchase to be protected by encrypted technology. That same year, a 30 year old Jeff Bezos quit his Wall Street job in hopes of starting an internet company, and Amazon.com was created. The company grew quickly, and in 1999, Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos “Person of the Year” for popularizing online shopping. Almost 25 years later, Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the US. In 1995, Pierre Omidyar founded the P2P retail site, ebay.com. The “auction”-style business model changed the way people shop at the turn of the century by allowing people to bid on items that spoke to them. In 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes store and by 2004, iTunes had sold 100 million songs. iTunes was revolutionary in that it aided in the acceptance and expansion of social sharing — people could now easily share and suggest their favorite music to friends over the internet. Why The Online Migration? According to theUS Census Bureau, as of 2016, 89% of US households have a computer in the home (up from 36.6% in 1997). In fast paced societies such as our own, the internet provides a convenience factor — whether that’s to research prices, or to purchase an item straight from a website with the click of a button. For consumers, there are also endless possibilities when shopping online — the internet knows no boundaries. Pozess and the Future of Ecommerce Pozess promises to continue the online shopping evolution. The blockchain-powered platform empowers the consumer to control the marketplace by sharing their favorite brands with the community while discovering and shopping new products they never knew existed. Social sharing plus the feeling of discovery make shopping fun and interactive, and put virtually unlimited choices of luxury fashion and lifestyle products in the hands of the consumer. We saw the history of ecommerce progress quickly with encrypted technologies and simple social sharing across the internet. The future of ecommerce lies in a cross between blockchain, social sharing, and consumer-controlled content, and Pozess is excited to be at the forefront of this revolution.

https://medium.com/@gibellino/3-video-streaming-technologies-for-2019-d51b6b1223d5?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,3 Video Streaming Technologies for 2019,Written byDiego Gibellino,"Diego Gibellino Follow -- Listen Share The new year is here and there is no better time to list 3 of the most promising technologies I expect to see in production in the video streaming arena in the next months… The Video Streaming Industry keeps experimenting and introducing innovative technologies, however the transition to production is not always as smooth as we would like or expect. There are implications in terms of costs, support by consumer devices, impact on established architectures, or, in some cases, a technology is simply not good enough for the market yet. The three technologies described below have an opportunity window in 2019. We will see how many services will embrace them. In 2018, an increasing number of players offering OTT commercial services included live events in their catalog. In addition to traditional IPTV, Cable, Satellite and Digital Terrestrial distribution, service providers operating mainly on the Internet, managed to acquire rights for Prime-time sport events such as Football, NFL, etc... These events were distributed through adaptive streaming, mainly using MPEG DASH and HLS, to a wide range of different devices, from smartphones to connected TVs, taking advantage of one or more CDNs (trying) to cope with the traffic demand. It turned out, however, that a major issue for this kind of services was the end-to-end latency or delay experienced by the user, in particular when compared to traditional broadcast distribution. Currently deployed HTTP-based adaptive streaming distribution architectures are usually behind broadcast of about 15–30 seconds, reaching 1 minute or more in some cases. This is considered a key aspect in terms of user acceptance, because subscribers are certainly not very happy to pay to watch a team score when their neighbors are already celebrating the goal. Technologies exist to reduce latency, and in particular, MPEG DASH provided extensions since the publication of the Second Edition of the Standard, in 2014. However, only in 2018, with the introduction of Common Media Application Format (MPEG CMAF) support in products, we have seen implementations tackling this issue in all the important building blocks of the architecture: Encoder, Packager, CDN, and Player. First results are promising, with end-to-end delays comparable to those provided by satellite or digital terrestrial (5 seconds or even below) and demonstrators able to reach ultra-low latency (below 1 second). In 2019 I expect to see production-ready solutions able to exploit CMAF low latency mode and commercial services able to deliver Prime-time sport events with reduced latency. It will be interesting to look at how far we can go in real services finding the right trade-off between latency, solution stability and robustness. This year we’ve witnessed the very first signs of the upcoming battle for the next generation video codec: VVC Vs AOM AV1. In April 2018, after a first exploration phase and a formal Call for Proposal, ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T VCEG launched the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET), whose objective is to develop the video codec successor to HEVC: Versatile Video CodingakaVVC. The VVC standard will be finalized by the end of 2020 and preliminary results show that it will be possible to increase the coding efficiency of HEVC of another 40–50% in terms of bitrate for an equivalent visual quality, with a reasonable increase in codec complexity. VVC is designed to fulfil the requirements of modern and next generation video services, including broadcast and unicast streaming delivery of Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) content, and 360 Video. The Alliance for Open Media(AOM) is an initiative created in 2015 by a number of important players in the video streaming and technology markets like Google, Mozilla, Netflix, etc…, with the objective of creating a royalty free video codec solution able to improve the current state of the art solutions. In 2018, AOM published version 1.0 of AV1 along with the software codebase available to all interested parties (aomenc). A number of scientific papers and studies compared AV1 and the software developed by JVET in the exploration phase, called Joint Exploration Model (JEM). Others compared AV1 and Reference software for AVC and HEVC, or AV1 with implementations such as x264 and x265. Relevant data were presented and discussed at IBC this year and in other conferences but figures, as always with codec comparison, largely depend on the target parameters and usage scenario considered by the authors (e.g. fixed QP, rate control, 1 or 2-pass etc…). However, AV1 has the potential to become at least an alternative to HEVC in terms of coding efficiency, although some additional work on optimization and hardware support is still needed and already planned. 2019 will not be the end of the battle, but it will certainly shed some more light on the contenders: AOM AV1 is expected to reach some level of maturity through commercial implementations and better hardware support, answering to concerns on encoder complexity raised by some studies. Commercial services will start using AV1 (some sample content is already available), at least for VoD content, taking advantage of browsers such as Chrome and Firefox that already provide decoding capabilities. VVC, on the other hand, will enter in the most important phase for its development, where critical decisions in terms of tools selection and complexity will be made. The decisions in JVET will define VVC performances, and probably, the video landscape in the next 5–8 years. It is therefore good to have some competition: it will help to raise the bar even more. One of the major concerns about the future of VVC is the licensing terms that will be defined for it. The development of the Standard is still ongoing, therefore nothing exists at this point yet, but VVC will likely require the payment of royalties to a group of patent owners. This mechanism proved to work well for previous codecs such as AVC or MPEG-2 Video but showed some shortcomings for HEVC. HEVC licensing is very difficult to understand and manage, with three patent pools and a number of companies that keep their IP aside. This situation is one of the reasons why HEVC deployment in the market is proceeding at a relatively slow pace since the Standard publication, in 2013. A group of companies recently created theMedia Coding Industry Forum(MC-IF), a forum that is willing to promote standard Media Coding solutions to the Industry and where parties involved can discuss issues related to the licensing of intellectual property rights relevant to the deployment and use of future Standards (e.g. VVC). How this and other initiatives may influence the licensing terms of forthcoming coding standards has to be seen, but it is definitely a step forward in the right direction. Content Adaptive Encoding is not a new thing. Netflix described this technique in 2015, with a blog post titledPer-Title Encode Optimization. The key concept is that video content may have different levels of visual complexity. Some content, when encoded, requires more or less bits (and bitrate) to achieve good or acceptable quality. If we are able to automate this decision each content may be encoded with just the right number of bits, and for adaptive streaming, the quality of each level of representation, also collectively known as the bitrate ladder, can be customized accordingly. How you can estimate content complexity efficiently and automatically in your transcoding workflow makes the difference. It is possible to use brute force algorithms based on a number of trial encoding during the ingestion phase and then analyze the resulting bitstreams with your preferred objective metric. Another approach is to adopt sophisticated Artificial Intelligence algorithms, typically based on Neural Networks, to extract meaningful video features from the ingested content, apply a model and constantly refine and improve it to match your content catalog. Impacts in terms of computation power, storage space, modifications to the workflow and digital asset management structure and publishing process may be different, and the approach to follow should be carefully evaluated and selected. Some service providers designed their own internal solution or they are currently working on it, but there are also products provided by encoder or technology platform suppliers, already integrated in their transcoding workflow. Whatever approach you prefer, be prepared to see CAE in production at scale in 2019. Low latency, new video codecs, and Content Adaptive Encoding are three technologies that will likely be adopted by an increasing number of commercial video streaming services in 2019. Solutions and products exist (except for VVC, of course, which is planned for end 2020), or are expected to reach maturity in the next months , allowing integration in production environments.",Diego Gibellino,https://medium.com/@gibellino?source=post_page---byline--d51b6b1223d5---------------------------------------,238,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg,2019-01-03T14:09:34.910Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@zcodesolutions/new-year-new-security-protocol-dc9303b94d4e?source=tag_archive---------86-----------------------,New Year new security protocol?,Written byzCode Solutions,"zCode Solutions Follow -- Listen Share With the coming of a new year comes new goals, new dreams — and most importantly, new technology. When technology has existed for a while we forget how sometimes there is a security risk involved in using it. This can be said about the file directory navigation system. Since the first computer system came out the hierarchical file structure could be navigated through the command line system. After operating systems improved and GUI (graphical user interfaces) systems evolved the computer’s internal file structure could be traversed through a GUI interface. Of course, with every new advancement comes new exploitation. Cyber criminals that gain access to your hardware can download sensitive documents with 2 to 3 clicks of a mouse. As a precautionary measure you could put a password on your work folder and make it more difficult to obtain your documents — but once that password is cracked, then it’s all for naught. To resolve this problem IBM has crafted an innovative piece of technology called the Decoy File system (DcyFS). Like layering a cake, the DcyFS overlays a custom view that can do each of the following: Remove sensitive data (1) Dynamically replace files with fakes (1) Inject new Decoy files (1) The DcyFS system provides write control on documents you designate as “sensitive.” With documents given the “sensitive” tag, the DcyFS system replaces those files with fakes. In addition it can also create a honeypot trap by adding fake documents to entice cyber criminals looking to steal information. Once the “honey pot” is accessed it will leave a forensic trail for specialists to analyze and identify the users main objective.

It can be solved, but only through the intersection of new technologies and fresh approaches with status-quo establishments in the water sector. Easier said than done, but what a huge opportunity. All things considered, urban water management sits low on the “environmental urgency” totem pole. A dangerous combination of institutional risk-aversion,paltry investmentin new technology, andartificially low water pricesfactor into this lethargy. Meanwhile, urbanization, the decay of century old infrastructure, and unpredictable weather patterns are straining urban water systems to the brink of failure. The Key to Climate Resiliency: Innovation It used to be that we could rely on past data to determine groundwater supplies or the potential for flooding in a given area. Those days are long gone. A changing climate is a present reality that has everything to do with our future water security. In 2017, extreme weather cost the U.S.$300 billion. Newscientific researchshows thatten timesmore Americans are at risk of being flooded out by rivers within the next 20 years, even if greenhouse emissions are completely and immediately curbed. If water security comes down to how cities address thisnew normal, old path-dependent approaches will prove disastrous. Knowing that current water infrastructure in the U.S. is nearing theend of its useful life, utilities are hurtling toward$700 Billionin new spending on water projects. This is an unprecedented opportunity for new approaches to be adopted by the industry. Fortunately, paradigm-shifting technologies are being (and have been) developed in each cog of the urban water cycle. Boldnew material technologiesin permeable paving for stormwater infrastructure, distributed water technologies, potable water reuse, andenergy recovery from wastewaterall show tremendous promise. These could be game-changers at scale, improving the physical structure and financial future for urban water systems…If given the chance. Financing the Future of Water: Institutional path-dependence is but one barrier for promising technologies. The other obvious barrier is the lack of private investment in the development and deployment these technologies. In a vicious circle, the industry that most needs new technologies repels the industry that invests in new technologies — venture capital. Herd mentality on top of herd mentality. Normally, promising startups turn to venture capital to finance growth. But in a dislocated (albeit, huge) industry with slow sales cycles and regulatory sluggishness, it turns out that venture capital isinherently at odds with water startups. Ironically, this probably bodes well for startups in the space. While institutional investors play follow the leader and pile into moremarketable environmental plays, innovative water technologies will be backed bynew financing mechanismsthat allow them to be developed, launched, and deployed in ways that can be truly impactful. It is my feeling that we are entering a truly disruptive period in water infrastructure. Regulatory policy-making is getting lapped by technological advances and new startup financing mechanisms likeequity crowdfundingare finding their footing. The truth is, real innovation finds its way around entrance barriers. And when outdated institutional factors influence decision making — even when a new technology demonstrates the massive potential to improve an existing issue — disruption looms.

Although the battle against Alzheimer still has a long way to go, with no effective cures on the market and no promising results yet for drugs designed to slow down the onset of the disease, researchers can at least now hope to detect the disease decades before its onset. Dr. Randall Bateman´s team at Washington University School of Medicine is developing a quick inexpensive amyloid beta blood test that can identify patients long before they start developing the symptoms. Identifying and treating patients sooner might help develop preventative measures. Another breakthrough test, developed at the University of Queensland, is a universal cancer test that can detect traces of any cancer in a blood sample in 10 minutes. The test is based on the discovery that cancer DNA sticks to metal surfaces in a different way to healthy DNA, which is much more heavily methylated. This translates into a colorimetric test in which gold nanoparticles interacting with the patient´s DNA will allow the detection of cancer DNA. Unfortunately 2018 has also opened our eyes about the great problem the planet faces due to pollution with plastic. On the brighter side, many talented researchers are racing against the clock to solve the issue. And as an example, a new enzyme is being developed to break down PET, which could allow plastic bottles to be fully recycled back into new bottles, limiting the need to produce new plastic. It will be exciting to see 2019 unfold and reveal new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that may hold the key to solving some of our society´s biggest problems.

In effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all. Here is our official 2018 review inspired by our values: We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it. 1.)Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way.Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right. 2.) 2018 was the year of women in action.From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history. 3.) Culture creators used releases as platforms to speak their point-of-view not just sell albums.Meek Mill launched his new album “Championships” yet spent all his airtime talking about criminal justice reform. And the First Step Act was passed (a criminal justice reform bill). We go out of our way to create a safe space for people to be vulnerable, creative and challenging. To be themselves, not who they think they ‘should’ be. 4.) Enough is enough.The students of Parkland became the faces of their generation as they rallied a nation and actively challenged government leaders and the NRA to protect our kids. 5.) We don’t have to think the same to love the same.Obama’s speech at John McCain’s funeral showed us how we don’t always have to see eye-to-eye to love and honor each other as human beings. 6.) Commercial beauty is a cage that must be broken.Korean women and men took a public stand against the extreme cultural beauty standards by starting the “Escape The Corset” movement. Commerce is predicated on growth but not all that grows is good. We pursue growth that is sustainable for people, the planet and profit. 7.) Artist expression is limitless when you are Donald Glover.His release of “This is America” under Childish Gambino proved you can maintain creative integrity in a multitude of verticals. 8.) If we learned anything from the past 5 years…ignoring sexism and racism will completely and totally slaughter your brand.Starbucks swiftly responded to racism by closing over 8,000 of its stores on May 29 to conduct unconscious bias training of its employees. 9.) We didn’t know that butterflies could go through metamorphosis to become even more glorious butterflies until Michelle Obama.Her release of Becoming solidified her role as a cultural leader and not just the forever queen of the White House. We see creativity as a mindset not a discipline. The art is in using it to create real value, with the entire company as our canvas. 10.) One Tweet can say everything.In releasing the Kapernick campaign Nike ran the usual playbook — beautiful film, OOH, etc — but it was the Tweet that gained the most media pick-up and consumer action in both conversation and dollars spent. 11.) Community fueled show development and releases created a flywheel amplification effect for Netflix.From To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before to Bird Box you might as well live in under a rock if you weren’t in on the memes. 12.) In response to Trump’s “shit hole countries” comment Airbnb focused on promoting travel to Haiti, El Salvador and Africa.Continuing the #weaccept narrative.",Jordan Schenck,https://medium.com/@JordanMarieS?source=post_page---byline--8f28326fcf77---------------------------------------,75,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png,2019-01-03T15:29:07.959Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@shaheenahmed/bandersnatch-the-meta-narrative-of-our-contemporary-times-6364a73eb60f?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,Bandersnatch: The Meta Narrative of our Contemporary Times,Written byShaheen Ahmed,"Shaheen Ahmed Follow -- 1 Listen Share A few days back, I watched Bandersnatch on Netflix. This is the first film offering from the makers of the ground-breaking dystopic science-fiction show, Black Mirror. True, to what Black Mirror represents, Bandersnatch, has altered notions of viewership and circulation in the history of the small screen. Set in 1984, the film is simply to say, the story of a teenage computer programmer who attempts to produce a highly conceptual and ambitious computer game, called the Bandersnatch. What is the most important point of and about the film is the change in the idea of viewership. The viewer is no longer a passive viewer, but an active participant in the history of cinema. The viewer is a ‘proscumer’, a producer as well as a consumer of the film. The viewer is the story teller and the director of the film as the film progresses. From making the decision about what to eat for breakfast to what music to listen to whether commit suicide or murder, the viewer gets to control the narrative, or so it appears. This is however, not the first foray into ‘make-your-own-adventure’ storytelling. As hasbeen written, there has been much experiments in literature and in Netflixitself. I am not going to go into the history of this genre, but will try and explain what makes Bandersnatch a one-of-its kind in the history of cinema that will mark the history of not just cinema but also digital humanities. Bandersnatch is not the first Black Mirror special during Christmas season. In 2014, the series showed its first special, White Christmas. After four years, it has come with a new special which has, as an understatement, shaken all its viewers. This is the first ‘film’ by the creators of the show and was streamed on Netflix globally on 28th December 2018. On the first glance, it looks the usual Black Mirror staple where the human fear of being controlled or annihilated by technology plays out. But, that is where the similarities with any other Black Mirror offering ends. I got to know about Bandersnatch when I chanced upon its trailer on Boxing Day on the show’s Facebook page. Like any other devout fan of the show, I was eagerly looking forward to the ‘film’. On the appointed day, I opened the Netflix website. I hovered my mouse over the Bandersnatch icon. The blurb showed that its about 90 minutes long. This appeared to me as usual. A Black Mirror special is not really of any longer duration. Bandersnatch, however, proved to be anything but the usual. It took me over three hours to finally ‘finish’ the film and over 90 minutes to actually understand that the director of the story is not David Slade. The film starts to offer you the option to ‘choose’ the moment you click the play button. Naive me, thought it is a new Black Mirror style of presenting the story. Although, the lack of the time code struck me as something odd, it still didn’t strike me till I was halfway through the film, that it was me who had the control of the story and be an active consumer of it. Much has already been written about the many endings of the show, the gargantuan amount of permutations and combinations of the film, including the final duration of the film. What I would like to concentrate on is not the possible or plausible endings, but the treatment of the film and the philosophy of the one figure who drives the film — how Charlie Brooker, the writer, doffs his hat to one of the most influential writer of science fiction in the 20th century and the one historical period that has fascinated most of the science fiction visualisations of the 21st century — the decade dominated by garish fashion and big hairdos, the 1980s. Bandersnatch is not a film, it is a concept, much like the conceptual video game that drives the core of the film. The term Bandersnatch was invented by Lewis Carroll, the writer of Alice in Wonderland. Carroll wrote about the Bandersnatch, a fantastical creature in 1872 in his book, Through the Looking- Glass. The creature does not really have a fixed form, it is never described in its totality by Carroll. It is just supposed to just have a long neck and jaws that snap and humans are supposed to steer clear of it. This obscure fantastical creature has had a long digital afterlife, however. There are two driving forces for the film — Philip K Dick or PKD as he is known and revered, and the pastiche and nostalgia for the 1980s. Bandersnatch, the eponymous title of the film is also a conceptual game that the lead of the film, 19 year old computer programmer, Stefan is attempting to develop. The game is based on a science fiction book by the same name written by an author called Jerome F Davies. Davies is described as a visionary genius who lost his mind and ended up killing his wife, a somewhat similar situation that Stefan will probably find himself into, depending on the choices the viewer chooses. Before talking about PKD, it is necessary to start the analysis with the 1980s. Bandersnatch shows the world of the 1980s in UK. It is a literal act of remembering and nostalgia as the writer of Black Mirror, Charlie Brooker grew up in the same period in Oxfordshire. The game that is in focus here is not a complex variety as those seen in Playstations, but what we may now term as a basic computer game. Millennials like us, grew up playing dozens of computer games such as Road Rash, Contra, Street Fighter, and of course, Mario. The film mirrors reality and pastiche on the 1980s, and more specifically, 1984. 1984 was the year when an actual computer game called Bandersnatch was under development by one of the biggest game companies around that time, Imagine Software, aimed for a Christmas release. The BBC documentary ‘Commercial Break’ looks at the computer game industry, the ecology of production, circulation and piracy. It also traces the development of the game and much like in the Netflix film, how the game never got released and finally led to the company’s liquidation. The mise-en-scene of the film, especially when it comes to the set design of Tuckersoft, the company producing the game, is eerily similar to the real life offices of Imagine and Ocean Software, the other company that the BBC documentary focuses. Office of Imagine Software — courtesy Commercial Breaks (Youtube) Bandersnatch, the film also mirrors the reality of the gaming industry in 1984. As is shown in the documentary, there were teenage prodigious game programmers who were employed in the big game companies. And much like the star programmer, Colin, in the film, there were young star programmers in the industry who led the fast life and earned enough to buy super cars and super bikes. Much like how Imagine Software spent millions in inventing new hardware along with the code for the game, Netflix too has spent a huge amount of money in enabling viewers to be able to access the film’s format. What does not miss the eye of the viewer is the pastiche for the 1980s in the film. As an avid lovers of contemporary science-fiction series and films, this pastiche here is not really new. Charlie Brooker engaged with the pastiche in one of the earlier Black Mirror episodes, the fabulously done San Junipero in 2016. The episode, is loosely described by many as alesbian love story. For a cinephile like me, however, it represented much more. Brooker engaged with genre film conventions in this episode and especially with the road film genre. I look at San Junipero as a utopic version of the 1991 Ridley Scott film, Thelma and Louise. The road movie as a genre leads to tragic circumstances and it was apparent in Thelma and Louise as well. In San Junipero, the trope of the genre is turned around and instead Brooker promises us a utopia in the digital afterlife due to technology. It is one of the very few films and even episodes in the entire Black Mirror series where there is a sort of happy ending unlike the dystopia that technology and artificial intelligence leads us to. Pastiche for the 1980s is also an overriding theme in another successful science-fiction/horror series on Netflix, Stranger Things directed by the Duffer Brothers. This series too starts in 1984 in a fictional town called Hawkins in the US state of Indiana. The series has had two seasons so far and is a science fiction fan favourite. It has led to a number of cosplays, memes and other fan fiction. The series too is dominated by everything 1980s in the Midwest. The music is a serious nostalgic journey for lovers of 1980s pop music and features among others Donna Summers, Cyndi Lauper, The Police, Duran Duran among others. Music in Bandersnatch too is seeped with nostalgia and music by the not very globally popular British band, Thomson Brothers, play in the film. However, the one film that is much closer to its theme to Bandersnatch, is the understated 2013 film, Computer Chess. Directed by Andrew Bujalski, the film is spatially and temporally, the predecessor to Bandersnatch. Set in 1980, the film shows a congregation of computer geeks who meet for an annual computer chess competition. Bujalski shot the entire film in analog technology (the Sony 1968 AVC-3260 B&W cameras) that was widely used in the early 1980s. The result is a look which is reminiscent of the early Doordarshan programs for us Indian millennials. What this pastiche and nostalgia, including technology for the 1980s show a return to pre-digital. A sort of rebellion in a way. An anti-millennial move, if I may say. Futurist Alvin Toffler coined the term ‘futureshock’ in his influential 1970 book by the same name. The term describes a psychological state for those ‘who are faced with too much change in too short a period of time”. What contemporary science fiction filmmakers are using as a trope is to apply future shock but in a time and space left behind rather than in the future. There is a fetishisation of the analog and the pre-digital era as one that could be both utopic and dystopic, human and nonhuman. This is a method in which an archive of the 1980s is being recreated. But, as David Bates writes (2010), the archive is only a partial truth. What then do we do with our memories? Memories of those who lived in the 1980s and those of the millenials who have experienced the 1980s through pastiche? Memory is crucial in this engagement as it becomes one of the key objects in the film as well. Viewers keep getting the opportunity to time travel and help Stefan out of a certain situation. Time travel here, means altering of the memory. Modernity has been characterized by a ‘crisis of memory’ as argued by Ina Blom (2017). She argues that there has been a ‘dissolution of time in an age of simulation and high-speed information networks’. And this has been aptly represented in the film, which the rest of the films mentioned here have also attempted in their own ways. However, Bandersnatch is most successful in this attention economy since, there is literal movement of the characters across time and space and to which, us, the viewers have absolute control over. This is what makes the film special. It not only has intervened in cinema viewing practices with a unique perspective but also gives us the impression that we are in control. Control and surveillance have been two themes that has been constant in the works of one of the greatest science fiction writers of all times, Philip K Dick.The film employs many of the themes recurring in the works of Dick. Jerome K Davies, the writer of the book, as is shown in the film has been developed on Dick’s persona. Although, Dick did not shoot himself or kill anyone, he obssesed his whole life over surveillance and on conspiracy theories. Many of Dick’s works have been adapted for the big screen, including Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly etc. Other directors such as the Wachowski Sisters have been influenced by Dick for their Matrix series. Michel Gondry too have cited Dick as an influence in making his masterpiece, An Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. A series, The Man on High Castle, based on his book name with the same title is currently being screened on Netflix. However, one of Dick’s most important and critical book, Ubik written in 1969, has not been adapted so far. There have been many attempts over the decades by directors such as Gondry have never culminated into reality. The reference to Dick or PKD as he is known by his fans, is referenced when there is a large poster of Ubik’s book cover on the wall of Colin’s home. Ubik, is Dick’s dystopia of a higher form of intelligence finally taking over control of human kind. The book also engages strongly with ideas about who or what is human. The control that we are allowed to exercise in Bandersnatch, is if we flip the coin, an exercise in surveillance too. We are the voyeurs who peek deep into Stefan’s mind and life. But, did we really make the choice? Did we actually direct the film? These are some of the poignant questions that the film leaves us with. Bandersnatch is much more than just a film. As a review in The Guardian correctly terms is as a ‘meta-masterpiece’. The film is indeed exploring the possibilities of being a meta narrative of our contemporary concerns. Perhaps, the apt way to end this piece is with a quote from Ubik, which throws us further into the abyss of an unknown and highly controlled future. “I am Ubik. Before the universe was, I am. I made the suns. I made the worlds. I created the lives and the places they inhabit; I move them here, I put them there. They go as I say, then do as I tell them. I am the word and my name is never spoken, the name which no one knows. I am called Ubik, but that is not my name. I am. I shall always be.” Shaheen Ahmed is a PhD Researcher in Cultural Studies at Monash University and a PKD fan",Shaheen Ahmed,https://medium.com/@shaheenahmed?source=post_page---byline--6364a73eb60f---------------------------------------,3,10 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY,2019-01-03T07:10:04.828Z,Medium

It helped industries to improve productivity. The Second Industrial revolution introduced electricity and other innovations in infrastructure. It created new industries and opportunities to thrive on mass production lines. When we arrived at the Third revolution during the late twentieth century, information technology was the major change agents towards the automation of production processes. And here we are now, the next big thing in the history of the industrial revolution — The Fourth one. It is getting much attention and hailed as important a milestone as the first one. Let’s have a look at why is that? Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is all about connectedness and how we can embed the technology into our societies and industries. All emerging technology breakthroughs will speed up the digitization of industries. Cloud technologies and 5G will be the front runners of this. A few examples of emerging fields are Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, The Internet of Things (IoT), where such innovation is happening. 4IR or Industry 4.0 is not about inventing technology for technology’s sake. The diagram below explains how 4IR is giving way to enhance connectedness and productivity and some of the social issues. This is the age of disruptive technology. It is creating a level playing field for businesses with innovative and agile business models. Whether it is an enterprise and small business, constant innovation and integration of the business processes has become evident. With No-code and Low-code development platforms, businesses can develop a software application without the need to write code. These platforms use visual modeling approach with pre-built functional components available in the platform library. The developers can just select the components and add to the workflow in line with the application. This helps developers to achieve the results with greater efficiency. This approach also makes the progress visible to all level of people in the business. Also saves businesses a lot of money as they do not need to maintain the stand-up environment and infrastructure. The platforms pretty much offer all in the package. Let’s take a look at how No-code and Low-code development capabilities work; No-code development capabilities No-code development capabilities provide business users to solve basic functional problems between the departments with simple solutions. These platforms will be more suitable to the SMBs to solve their integration challenges without hiring a professional developer as there is no need to write a code to implement such applications. Low-code development capabilities Low-code capabilities cater to Enterprises that have technology governance requirements. It uses a more synchronized approach with scalable architectures and flexibility in terms of on-prem or cloud implementation. Low-code platforms also extend the capabilities with the use of open APIs. It supports complex integrations using comprehensive components in the platform library and the ability to incorporate all the innovative next-generation technologies and third-party services available via open source. This platform can create sophisticated applications for enterprises that encompasses various departments and domains. It offers better control to the developers for quality testing and performance tools which results in high productivity and speedy deployment. With the choices and capabilities, the integration platform offers, there is no denying the power of APIs that helps these integrations possible. As businesses grow bigger, requirements also grow wider. Enterprises need applications to work across departments and domains. They need to incorporate next-gen technologies to increase productivity. Then there is regulatory compliance and technology governance. Also, there are challenges of modernizing the legacy systems to co-exist with Cloud infrastructure. APIs act as an intermediary between on-prem and cloud, so all the other applications remain neutral to the platform they are installed on and maintain access to the data and other services as they move to the cloud. Integration Platformsand APIs work hand in hand to help businesses integrate applications and manage data with faster deployment and higher efficiency. It saves the organization time, money, and needless to say, the errors generating from the complex coding. These platforms can drive the revolution by speeding up productivity to many folds.

https://medium.com/bitstamp-blog/entering-the-second-crypto-decade-10ab-515ea91ae79f?source=tag_archive---------54-----------------------,Entering the second crypto decade #10AB,Published inBitstamp Blog,"Bitstamp Follow Bitstamp Blog -- 1 Listen Share Different cultures celebrate New Year on different dates. For most of the world, the new year happened two days ago. For us, it’s today. As we enter the second crypto decade, we’ve chosen a new date as our time to reflect back and think about the future. Bitcoin was launched on 3 January 2009, exactly 10 years ago. For us in crypto, this is the most significant date there is. To mark our commitment both to the industry and the unique culture that emerged in this community, we propose a new New Year. 2019 AD with its beginning on 1 January doesn’t really have much significance for us. Rather than that, we’re celebrating the year 10 AB starting on 3 January. Anno Domini becomes Anno Bitcoin. After the massive bull run of 2017, people have been talking about 2018 as a down-period for crypto. For those of us in the industry, it has actually been the more exciting year. The bull run was a crazy period that saw the entire industry scrambling just to keep up with demand. After the rally, we were able to examine our processes and improve our foundation for the future.But the thing is, 2018 hasn’t really been a down-period. Now that the year is over, we can look back and put it in perspective. In comparison with 2017, both the trading volume and total number of trades increased significantly. On the industry side, these numbers show a very successful year, with definite growth. The reality for investors, however, is a bit different. Prices have gone down across the board, but the situation is better for some cryptocurrencies than others. There’s a belief that prices move more or less in unison — the market follows the movements of BTC. But if we take a look at the average prices over the entire year and compare that with the current price, the picture looks a bit different, with some of the 5 cryptocurrencies Bitstamp supports currently sitting much further from their average than others. For us at Bitstamp, the last year of the first crypto decade was all about growth. We continued scaling our team in all departments and reached a few important partnerships to improve our tech arsenal. In November, we partnered with Cinnober, a global independent provider of technology solutions for the finance industry, to create a new matching engine for our exchange. “Our platform’s order matching speed is expected to become 1250x faster, while throughput will increase by 400x.” — David Osojnik, Bitstamp CTO “Our platform’s order matching speed is expected to become 1250x faster, while throughput will increase by 400x.” — David Osojnik, Bitstamp CTO The traditional financial infrastructure has, historically, pushed crypto away. When Bitstamp was founded, there was no way we could get a partnership with a clearing house, or a custodian, or a kyc provider. It was up to us to establish the processes we needed to function, meanwhile a traditional exchange could just outsource each part of their operations to a company that focuses on that specific field. Our vision is to provide the bridge between these two worlds. Our vision is to provide the bridge between these two worlds. However, as the crypto market matures, it is growing closer to traditional finance. Our vision is to provide the bridge between these two worlds. Creating a new matching engine in close cooperation with Cinnober is another step on that journey. Besides catching up with traditional finance performance-wise, our goal for the second decade is to maintain our position as a pioneer of best-practices in security and consumer protection in crypto. The main topic emerging in the industry right now is ensuring market integrity and establishing more consumer protection. In order to stay at the forefront on these matters, we recently partnered with Irisium, a state of the art market monitoring platform. We already placed an emphasis on market integrity and are entering the new decade with a technology upgrade on that front. Our goal for the second decade is to maintain our position as a pioneer of best-practices in security and consumer protection in crypto. Our goal for the second decade is to maintain our position as a pioneer of best-practices in security and consumer protection in crypto. Bitstamp has been supporting the crypto industry longer than any other active exchange. A few years ago, we assessed the direction crypto was going and decided to focus on building a strong foundation based in security, reliability and compliance. For the past few years, that’s been our focus and we’ve made significant progress. But the work we’re doing isn’t always obvious to the public — you don’t see the underlying infrastructure, just the front end on our webpage or app. We’re aware it’s been a while since our user interface was updated. However, we intend on changing that very soon. Bitstamp has been supporting the crypto industry longer than any other active exchange. Bitstamp has been supporting the crypto industry longer than any other active exchange. Everyone on our team is excited about the second crypto decade, because for us, it represents a turning point. The foundation has been built, now we get to work on projects that will be directly visible to our users, starting with the launch of our new mobile app! A brand new iOS and Android app is currently in closed beta testing and will be publicly released by the end of January. That’s how we’re starting 10 AB. Expect to see more announcements, partnerships and product updates over the course of the year. The second crypto decade is here and we’re confident this is the era when we finally bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance.

https://medium.com/clippings-autumn-2018/you-are-fake-news-41c04d48b30a?source=tag_archive---------88-----------------------,You Are Fake News,Published inClippings Autumn 2018,"Joss Biddle Follow Clippings Autumn 2018 -- Listen Share When you see the words ‘fake news’, you probably start to think of click-bait popping up on your social media feed, or some story in the papers the other day which got discredited the day after, or President Trump’s face swims before your eyes. You can practically hear him saying it. ‘Fake news’. I’m here to tell you, that you, are (probably) fake news. If you have a social media account, the chances are you are at least vaguely aware of your online image, you know what you have uploaded to your profile(s) and you don’t put any old toot up there. Why? It’s because, whether you admit it or not, you want to look good in the eyes of others. From the profile picture you set, to the daily, weekly or monthly posts you make (depending on how much of a lurker you are) you are making decisions about how you want people to perceive you; a physical image and a personality image. A cherry-picked impression of the real life you. You, but through rose coloured spectacles. I’m not going to tell you this is a terrible thing that you shouldn’t do. After all, you should be careful what you put online these days, especially with nosy potential employers turning to social media to get a behind-the-curtain look at prospectus employees and their habits. However, when you start to see other people’s online profiles, it can be easy to forget that they do the exact same thing. In fact, according to the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’¹ 36% of people aged 18–34 admitted they deceive their social media followers with their posts, making their holidays seem greater than they were. The main reasons for doing this were to either make their followers envious, or to try and one up the other accounts they followed on social media. This can end up giving the rather depressing impression that your life only has great bits in a sea of mediocrity, but everybody else is always having an absolutely great time. All the time. It unsurprising then, that social media users tend to have be more depressed¹. It’s important to maintain perspective when using social media, as the saying goes, ‘the grass is always greener on the other side’. Well now the other side is covered in flowers, puppies are everywhere and the old worn-down shed is covered by Potter’s cloak of invisibility. It’s hard not to be dissatisfied with your own patchy grass when faced with that. Interestingly, despite admitting to being deceptive in their own posts online, the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’ showed that people trust posts from others they know personally on social media the most, followed by trusted brands, then media organisations and lastly posts from social media users they don’t know personally.¹ This tells us we still rely on knowing a ‘source’ personally to trust them rather than the general reputation of said source. When you only trust and add people, that you know personally off social media, on social media, the networking features of social media seem pointless. Perhaps then, social media idea is just a big fat fakery platform, and the only way to view it is cynically. A platform for image selling. So take it with a pinch of salt, embrace the false nature of it, and use it with that in mind. Through this lense though, its hard to see the point of social media networking. Want to share a photo? Share it to a group ‘WhatsApp’ chat. Want to keep in contact with someone? Exchange numbers. It seems to me the only niche function of social media is that it allows you to maintain a vague connection with acquaintances and snoop on people youusedto know. With the function and effects of social media coming into question, many are asking themselves whether they’re wasting their time on these networking sites. For the first time Emarketer predicted the decline of users of Facebook aged 18 to 24². With Facebook, the most widely used social media platform³, losing the interest of younger generations, social media may be showing some signs of losing relevancy. Moving on into the new year, it may be time foryouto assess your use of online networking and decide if you really want to invest any more time in the endless news feeds of social media.

Here is the transcript: 1. What advice would you give to a student that is looking to venture into this field? I would advise to focus on one aspect of digital marketing per say and become an expert at it; however, I would highly recommend that you do not limit yourself to one aspect of Digital Marketing. You should be aware and knowledgeable of all aspects of what Digital Market offers to its audience. If you are a graphic designer; learn Photoshop, InDesign, but also study UX, web development, Marketing/Social Media Strategies. The more you understand of Digital Marketing conceptually and the various facets/marketing vehicles it offers and how they work; the more marketable you become as a Potential Hire. Furthermore, by learning all aspects of this field, it can help assist your creativity and/or make your Marketing strategies more effective. Keep Learning. There are several online tools and courses available for anyone to continue their education and practice. A lot of resources are free and there are several Digital Marketing Experts who have insightful online blogs, courses, Twitter Chats, etc. that one can take advantage of. The Tech and Digital Marketing field is constantly changing; so staying connected, learning and practicing is highly recommended. Other factors to consider: Keep your portfolio up to date and easy to access. Request testimonials and referrals from your clients. Network, Network, Network. Attend meetups and conference or join online Groups of different Creatives. Another great way to stay abreast of what is trending in the industry and these also offer potential partnering or employment opportunities. Research and monitor Employers that you would like to work for one day. Study their Marketing/Social Media strategies and identify patterns of success and engagement. This will provide you great insight for any potential interviews. Learn about how Contracts work. If you are an Independent Contractor — this is vital. Know your rights. Protect your work. Do your own Salary Surveys so that you understand the market. This also provides you a realistic view of Salary Trends in your field. Important when targeting new jobs…. 2. When reviewing applications and potential candidates to work with, what is something that stands out to you? I think someone who is confident but one that is willing to learn and that is a good team player. In our industry, a Designer, Video Producer, Web Developer, Social Media Strategist is one member of the team. Communication skills and willing to work with others is key. Also, having a good understanding of UX and the importance of establishing goals, objectives and ways to measure success for any design, strategy, tool is also important. We want someone who isn’t just looking to create something; but someone who can understand an objective, create with a purpose and track its success. Work should be relevant to the client’s objectives. 3. What are the creative steps you take when working with a new client? It depends on the project/Digital Marketing Vehicle we are producing, but typically we follow this workflow: Define Statement of Work — Objective/Deliverables/Establish Metrics for Success Establish Timeline Needs Assessment — Review Existing Client’s metrics, Branding Assets, Successes. Conduct Client Surveys to obtain feedback on Target Audiences, Branding Requirements, etc. UX — create Wireframes or drafts of concepts Design/Produce — create the Design with full creative assets (fonts, imagery, texture, taglines, call to actions) Client Review Adjust Test Deploy/Launch Monitor Report Assess/Modify if necessary. These were my quick fire answers. I am always interested in feedback. I personally have been in the tech field for over a decade working as a Project/Program Manager. I would love to hear from you.",Melissa A,,10,3 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg,2019-01-03T00:04:58.782Z,Medium

The Short Answer to the expensiveness of Rolls is : Because nearly every task is completed by hand. Where in the modern world, most of the luxury car companies prefer to build their cars by robots, the Rolls Royce prefers to use the humans instead. Let’s take an example,The grills on the front section of the Rolls: No measurement instruments are used to build this grill, it’s solely made by hands. It takes one man one day to build a Rolls Royce grill and 5 hours are spent polishing it.

While we were there, I noticed the Aubrey and the Three Migos concert was also happening the same weekend. Granted, I saw Drake on tour literally the week before in Oakland, but I was still super stoked and thought “Hmm, maybe I’ll randomly run into Drake while I’m here”. Spoiler Alert: I didn’t meet Drake, but I did come up with a super cool idea for the culture! #DoItForTheCulture If you know me or follow me on Instagram @Kyleculus, you may have noticed that a lot of my captions are Drake lyrics. I often struggle with captions so I generally default to the wise Socrates…I mean…Drake for counsel as his songs are relatable and a representation of the grandiose lifestyle I want to live. As a huge procrastinator via Instagram, neglecting my responsibilities and scrolling endlessly, I noticed I wasn’t the only person that uses Drake lyrics as captions. Odell Beckham Jr., a close friend of Drake, actually does this all the time. I have a computer science background and work professionally as a Software Engineer, so I decided to take on the adventurous endeavor to build Drakestagram.Drakestagramis a website where people can search keywords based on the vibes of their photo, and it returns them with a lyric to use as a caption. The website went up New Years Day (2019) and in the first two days of the website being up, there were over 2,400 searches for Drake lyrics! And the most searched keyword so far is “Love”, I guess cuffing season is in full effect! Huge shoutout to everyone that’s supported Drakestagram so far!

Whereas I have made some fantastic friends, experienced new additions to the family, it has mainly been about serving hundreds of families across Islamabad and in the process, creating jobs. Win-win. What better way to spend a year, right? I would like to thank everyone who has been directly or indirectly involved in this journey with us. Since 2018 has seen RAFT Bazaar grow, today I’d like to talk more about what we’ve already achieved and what our goals are for 2019. Let’s jump right into. 1.We are Proud to have served more than a 100 customersacross Islamabad and we are THRILLED to have achieved that within 1 year. (More of the same for 2019 please.) 2.We have created jobs— mainly in our Operations Team and Associate Riders. That is a direct result of our customers’ belief in our service and team. You (the customers) have directly contributed to uplifting lives. Thank You from all of us 3. We have been able to create alittle impact in terms of reducing carbon emissions. Our Associate Riders assemble collective orders most of the time — delivering value to homes and resulting in fewer cars on the road for a shopping trip. We believe collective effort is a sure shot way to reducing carbon emissions and improving the environment around us. 1.Number one on our agenda for 2019 is toexpand into other major citiesin the country — and yes, that includes Rawalpindi which is our top target for 2019. 2.There are AMAZING surprises in store in terms ofproduct assortment.

https://medium.com/@itsnathandaily/my-simple-approach-to-testing-1b08a4dbf5ae?source=tag_archive---------144-----------------------,My Simple Approach to Testing,Written byChi Kenechukwu,"Chi Kenechukwu Follow -- Listen Share Start with the APIs I try to understand how each exposed API works and how it connects to the backend. I see it as a big black box unit that accepts inputs and sends back responses. Questions I ask myself are: What are the APIs and how do they get called? Is it possible to emulate the entire platform from the API layer, using a tool like Postman or even in Java. Write behavioral, positive and negative API tests in postman. I try to get as much coverage as possible. Finally, I automate the API tests. The User Interface I design the UI tests from the acceptance criteria and collaborate with the developers ahead of time. In the tests, I include negative, boundary and edge cases. In addition to the designed tests, I manually test the UI in exploratory style (mostly to discover edge cases). I add any test case I find to the set of test cases already drafted. I ensure the entire UI test cases are automated. Stubbing and mocking When testing a particular UI feature, I try to stub out the back end (To be more succinct, I stub out the API that is called from the UI). I do this to strictly focus on functionality. For the web and app UIs, I use Apimocker to create localhost server to which I would conveniently programme to give me the desired response that I want and I would use Charles Proxy’s remapping tool to redirect the API call and return the response that the UI needs. Automated Tests When writing automated tests- I design them to be configurable. Especially when it comes to the following Page objects Web and App elements Different Test environments Different types of test data And anything else I can think off. Making the automated tests configurable can be cumbersome to set up, but it goes a long way. People looking to add to or understand the test code always appreciate this. Testing Performance and Stress I like to operate performance and stress tests from the API layer rather than from the UI. I use JMeter but there are so many other tools that can be used to do this. Key performance indicators I use are the following Response times for each input (including end to end tests) The maximum number of users at a specific time that would crash the application. This part can be broken down to users per specific function. Determine what you would like your maximum to be and optimize.

We know the delight of peeling the plastic from a new iPhone. Eventually, that new-gadget feeling fades. The time comes to buy a newer, better product. For those in Apple’s ecosystem in particular, the process can become a blur of comparison shopping. There are eight modern iPhones to choose from if you count the Plus models and last year’s iPhone X; four Apple Watch options; five iPads; and seven Macs before you even start to adjust their specs. Though the rate at which people replace their old phones hasslowed, they’re still upgrading within two years on average, and Apple sold more than216 millioniPhones last year. The dizzying cost-benefit calculation happens all the time. “It is very hard to know that the ‘best’ is, and this drives maximizers to look at what others have,” says Barry Schwartz, author ofThe Paradox of Choiceand a professor of social theory at Swarthmore College.

https://medium.com/trocafone/hackathon-ideas-para-desarrollar-1d6ab9af3bd0?source=tag_archive---------57-----------------------,Hackathon: Ideas para desarrollar,Primera Versión,"Lucía Serigos Follow Trocafone -- Share Cuando se trata de compartir, de innovar y de proponer en Trocafone todos se involucran, y no hay momento de mayor creatividad, ingenio y espíritu de equipo que una Hackathon. Cuatro veces al año dedicamos un día entero para que las mejores ideas puedan cobrar vida. Durante la Hackathon se experimentan nuevas tecnologías, se crean y mejoran herramientas que servirán para nuestro trabajo diario y se busca perfeccionar el funcionamiento de nuestro producto. Cada detalle durante este día puede hacer la diferencia, porque de eso se trata, de aplicar toda la creatividad para generar ideas útiles a futuro, y, sin dudas, pasar un gran momento junto al equipo. Cada tres meses realizamos nuestra tan esperada Hackathon,un espacio que disfrutamos y aprovechamos para poner nuestras mejores ideas sobre la mesa y empezar a crear. Para que todo esto pase, unas semanas antes, los miembros del equipo proponen ideas. En formato depitchse comenta el objetivo y los recursos que van a ser necesarios. Lo interesante es que de esta manera se da lugar a la interacción de los distintos integrantes de los equipos, cada uno aportando y compartiendo sus conocimientos. Son muchos los proyectos que, con mucho esfuerzo y dedicación, nacieron en una Hackathon. Seleccionamos algunas de nuestras experiencias para que sus protagonistas pudieran relatar sus historias y compartirlas con todos. En las siguientes líneas, van a poder disfrutar las palabras de los integrantes de cada trabajo. Primera Versión Durante la primera Hackathon de Trocafone, allá por mayo de 2017, nació la versión 1.0 de este proyecto. La idea surgió por el interés de algunos por el desarrollo de videojuegos (o mejor dicho, su adicción a los mismos). Originalmente se pensó hacer unidle gamecon el modelo de negocio de Trocafone, con gran cantidad de mejoras e intrincadas reglas. No solo buscaba reflejar el procesocorede la empresa (compra, reacondicionamiento y venta de celulares), sino tambiénla influencia de cada sector que compone la compañía. Para esta primera versión, el equipo estuvo conformado por una desarrolladora frontend, un desarrollador backend y un analista de marketing. El desarrollo se encaminó por la parte de venta,dejando de lado la generación de stock o la reparación de celulares, y pensando en incrustarse como un módulo en una versión más abarcativa. Buscamos en los perfiles de Facebook de los chicos de marketing las fotos más vergonzosas. A partir de ahí se crearon mejoras referidas a sus preferencias o alguna situación graciosa. Además se agregó unsliderde frases graciosas relacionadas al juego o -anécdotas de la oficina, como por ejemplo: -“Siempre que juego al Troca Clicker ligo el ancho de espadas” - Gonzálo Higuaín-“¡Mamá cortaste toda la LOOOZ! Estaba jugando al Troca Clickers” -“Siempre que juego al Troca Clicker ligo el ancho de espadas” - Gonzálo Higuaín-“¡Mamá cortaste toda la LOOOZ! Estaba jugando al Troca Clickers” A medida que avanzaba el día nos dimos cuenta que iba a ser imposible crear los tres flujos (compra, reparación y venta). Entoncesnos focalizamos en balancear el juego y mejorar el material.Agregamos un comportamiento donde cada determinado tiempo te pedían pagar sueldos y si no estabas atento renunciaba alguien. Al finalizar el día tuvimos la primera versión, conel foco puesto en el funcionamiento de la venta y con un montón de referencias graciosas del día a día.Esa Hackathon se dieron premios al desarrollo más votado y el ganador fue Troca Clickers. Creemos que la principal razón fue la empatía que generó el trabajo, además de su desarrollo (buscando fotos, frases anecdóticas y demás), funcionalidad y usabilidad del juego. Segunda versión La segunda versión contó con cuatro desarrolladores: dos se dedicaron al frontend y otros dos a evolucionar las reglas y el comportamiento. El objetivo ahora era hacer un contenido más sobrio, sin dejar de lado el humor,pero no tan específico de nuestra gente. La idea era hacer un producto que se pudiera mostrar en el stand que armamos de Trocafone para conferencias, donde los asistentes se pudiera acercar y jugar.Buscábamos que tuviera las tres partes fundamentales de nuestro negocio: compra, reacondicionamiento y venta. La primera hora y media del día se dedicó a definir Gameplay y UI. Pudimos usar la imaginación y tirar ideas para un juego. Luego nos pusimos a desarrollar los dos equipos. En el backend llevamos un estado del juego que iba atravesando en cadagameloopuna parte del flujo. Quisimos agregar un cuarto paso financiero, donde se paguen los sueldos cada cierta cantidad de iteraciones. Desde el lado del backend (lógica del juego) queremos mencionar una estrategia que utilizamos. Primero enfatizamos el contexto:Teníamos muchas ideas para aplicar a la mecánica del juego. Algunas indispensables y otrasnice to have.Contábamos con un tiempo muy limitado: 4 o 5 horas.Éramos dos personas trabajando en un desarrollo pequeño.Entonces necesitábamos poder:Paralelizar al máximo las tareas.Agregar de forma fácil features.Dar por finalizado el desarrollo en cualquier momento, sin importar cuáles de las tareas quedaban sin realizarse. Primero enfatizamos el contexto: Teníamos muchas ideas para aplicar a la mecánica del juego. Algunas indispensables y otrasnice to have. Contábamos con un tiempo muy limitado: 4 o 5 horas. Éramos dos personas trabajando en un desarrollo pequeño. Entonces necesitábamos poder: Paralelizar al máximo las tareas. Agregar de forma fácil features. Dar por finalizado el desarrollo en cualquier momento, sin importar cuáles de las tareas quedaban sin realizarse. Lo logramos diseñando la solución como unpipe-and-filters. En cada iteración o “turno” del juego, se pasaba de forma secuencial por cadafilteroflowdel juego (reparación, compra, venta, contratación, upgrade y pago de sueldos). Además manejamos un contexto compartido por todos losfiltersdel que leían y escribían los atributos que necesitaban. De esta manera logramos agregarflowsal juego de forma incremental y casi transparente. A las 3pm era nuestrodeadlinepara modificaciones. A partir de ahí nos dedicamos a integrar con el frontend y corregir algún bug. Finalmente lo jugamos para poder balancearlo y obtener un juego divertido y funcional. Para esotocamos los precios de venta, los costos de compra y reparación.Según lo que configuramos a veces era imposible ganar, otras lo era perder. Pudimos llegar a una versión perfectible, pero bastante buena. Por más compleja o simple que pueda ser una aplicación, existen ciertos conceptos que no pueden escapar de su órbita: integración continua ydeployment, dos claros ejemplos de ello. Es verdad que un simple “¡Hola mundo!” no requiere que estemos pensando en esto, pero,¿qué pasaría ahora si quisiéramos complejizar nuestra aplicación, distribuir entre varios desarrolladores y automatizar nuestrosdeployments?Este planteo nos lleva a pensar en soluciones orientadas a lo que en la jerga se pueden abreviar como “CI/CD”. Suponiendo que ya se tenga una solución operativa, ¿qué puntos de mejora se pueden atacar? Este fue el desafío que nos enfrentamos en la última Hackathon. Con la necesidad de implementar mejoras para el actual “Trocabot” (bot de slack para automatización de tareas, implementado originalmente en otra Hackaton), nos dispusimos adiseñar una PoC, para elpipelinecompleto del proyecto. La PoC contó con 3 pilares, que esperábamos al final del día pudieran conectarse. 1. Trocabot: se trabajó para la implementación de las mejoras en el manejo dedeploymentsy ambientes.2. CI/CD: se trabajó con la implementación de una nueva versión de Jenkins + Pipelines + Blueocean, para poder definirpipelinesdedeployments.3. Infraestructura: se trabajó con todo lo que sucedía en los puntos anteriores e iba a ejecutarse, ni más ni menos que unclusterde K8s. 1.

Llegado al final de la hackaton, si bien no se pudo contar con unpipelinecompletamente automatizado,logramos objetivos claros que nos allanaron bastante el camino para el futuro. En su ciclo de vida,un celular en Trocafone atraviesa un flujo bastante complejo, desde su compra y logística inversa; su revisión y reparación; hasta su venta por alguno de los canales, logística directa y la posibilidad de que se termine devolviendo. Ese flujo es una simplificación. Cada uno de los puntos que mencioné tiene varios pasos internos, y su avance no es lineal. De la mayoría de los estados, un celular puede ir a más de un lugar, por ejemplo: después de su reparación un celular puede ir astock, descartarse o volver a ser reparado. Entender ese flujo en papel no es fácil. Nuestra idea era armaruna herramienta gráfica que permita visualizar los diferentes estados de Trocafone, y los posibles caminos entre ellos.La representación que nos pareció ideal es un grafo dirigido, donde los nodos son los diferentes estados posibles, y las aristas son los posibles movimientos. Encontramosuna biblioteca de Javascript para visualización de grafos, y con su ayuda armamos una aplicación web, que dada una definición de flujo lo grafica, permite agrupar estados (y luego ocultar las agrupaciones) y resalta los posibles caminos entre ellos. Extendimos un poco el alcance inicial del proyecto y le agregamos la posibilidad de visualizar la cantidad de teléfonos en cada estado (con el tamaño de los nodos), y de resaltar el flujo de un celular particular. La motivación nació ya que sabíamos quehabían muchos teléfonos que, por tener alguna falla (ej: GPS), no eran aptos para la venta y quedaban en un stock de descarte.Entonces, se nos ocurrió que un mosaico de teléfonos, como el de televisores en los noticieros, podría quedar simpático y llamar la atención para la recepción de Trocafone. En una primera Hackathon se hizo una prueba de concepto con cuatro teléfonos y una aplicación en Android. Lamentablemente, al final del día descubrimos que con elapproachplanteado presentaba problemas para escalar a más dispositivos. A raíz de eso, decidimos tomar unapproachdiferente en una siguiente Hackathon e implementamos una solución superadora sobre 30 dispositivos. Ésta se basa en un servidor de control, desarrollado en Node.js, al que todos los dispositivos se conectan mediante una app Android.Para evitar configurar en cada dispositivo la dirección IP del servidor, se implementó una solución basada enmulticast.Al mismo tiempo, se le fueron agregando distintas funcionalidades:slideshowde imágenes y la generación automática de untemplatecon las posiciones de cada celular a partir de una foto sacada a la configuración física de los dispositivos en el mosaico. Además del reto de construir elsoftware, tuvimos que lidiar con problemáticas delhardwarecomo mantener los dispositivos conectados a la red eléctrica sin que se vean los cables. El primer uso que se le dio al mosaico fue para elstandde Trocafone en la NodeConf 2018. A futuro queremos implementar la capacidad de mostrar un video y realizar una integración con el TrocaSnake de tal forma que en cada dispositivo pueda mostrar una partida en vivo. El Snake del Nokia 1100 fue un gran juego que marcó toda una generación, a la cual pertenecemos. Como nuestro negocio se basa en la venta de celulares reacondicionados, entre otros tipos productos, tuvimos ganas de hacer nuestra versión. La idea nació con el objetivo de dar una solución que pudiera resolver la necesidad del equipo de tecnología yrecruitingde cara a la NodeConf 2018: conseguir nuevos perfiles y seguir sumando talento al equipo. Aprovechamos el contexto de la Hackathon para resolver un problema claro, y la mejor manera que encontramos para hacerlo fue de una forma lúdica. El proyecto nos parecía sumamente atractivo, nos rememora a nuestra infancia y lo más interesante era que podríamos relacionarlo directamente con el negocio. ¿Cómo logramos conseguir losleads? Desde elloginde LinkedIn tuvimos acceso a datos valiosos de los posibles candidatos. Además armamos unrankingpara resaltar los mejores resultados e identificar al mejor de cada jornada, para luego hacer un sorteo entre los primeros y darle un premio. En cuanto a las tecnologías utilizamos unstackisomórfico utilizando librerías com React, Redux, PixiJS, Node, Express. Usando Typescript como sintaxis y PostgreSQL para persistir los datos. Terminamos 2018 con enormes proyectos, algunos mencionados en este artículo; grandes ideas; importantes objetivos; y muchas ganas de seguir creciendo y aprendiendo. Esperamos seguir por este camino y construir mucho más a partir de nuestras queridas Hackathones.",Lucía Serigos,https://medium.com/@lucia.serigos?source=post_page---byline--1d6ab9af3bd0---------------------------------------,5,9 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*gK_1lEMuZEjibSxx.|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*IduCM8zfX5IHVyyOIOu7ag.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*IduCM8zfX5IHVyyOIOu7ag.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*IduCM8zfX5IHVyyOIOu7ag.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*gK_1lEMuZEjibSxx.|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*gK_1lEMuZEjibSxx.,2019-01-15T14:42:57.815Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@shelbyirwin/3-questions-from-amazon-alexa-smart-home-pop-up-store-94f82ae2dd3?source=tag_archive---------164-----------------------,3 Questions From Amazon Alexa Smart Home Pop-Up Store,Written byShelby,"Shelby Follow -- Listen Share The other day I was casually walking down Yonge Street when I suddenly got stopped by a creative and super excited Amazon employee who wanted me to experience the Amazon Alexa Smart Home Pop-up Shop. I’m interested in technology so I decided to experience Amazon Echo’s lineup of Alexa-powered devices. When I entered the Pop-up Shop, I was greeted by friendly Amazon staff who offered me coffee as I patiently waited for a guide to take a group through a tour of a home fully equipped withAmazon Echo.Amazon Echo is a hands-free speaker you control with your voice. Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to play music, ask questions, make calls, send and receive messages, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more — instantly Once the guide arrived we walked along a laneway and reached the front door of the smart home. There we were greeted with some interesting technology. Alexa Smart Lock This technology is the answer for anyone who ransacks their pocket or purse in desperation to find their keys. With the Alexa Smart Lock, you don’t need a physical key! You can easily unlock a door with your voice and enter a code on your device. Alexa Ring Smart Doorbell No solicitation sign here! The Alexa Ring Smart Doorbell is equipped with a camera and microphone that allows you to view who is knocking on your door, without leaving the comfort of your couch. With your smartphone, you can access the doorbell even if you’re on the other side of the world! Next, when we entered the home, the guide announced to Alexa that he was home. Without a question or a doubt, Alexa (using SmartThings) followed his command and immediately turned on the lights. In less than a minute our guide also dimmed the lights and transitioned them to red, green, yellow and blue. As I was mesmerized by the colorful lights, he proceeded to direct Alexa with simple spoken commands to do the following: · Adjust the thermostat to ensure the room temperature was comfortable (ecobee thermostat) · Start and play a movie · Lower the window shades · Start to clean the floors with the help of an automaticRoomba Vacuumcleaner · Play, stop and skip music by using Amazon’s Prime Music streaming service After being fully immersed in the living room we made our way to the kitchen and was introduced to the Samsung Smart Home Fridge, a stainless steel beast that displayed everything inside on a bright screen along the right-hand panel. Without exerting energy, you can view exactly what the beast had to offer without opening its door! Although if you want a sandwich you’d need to physically open the fridge door to access the foods items and make it yourself. If you’re missing an item, don’t sweat because Alexa can help create a personalized grocery list. For people who desperately try to avoid the kitchen, don’t fret because Amazon Echo is here to save your day! With a quick Alexa command you can, automatically turn on your kettle (with the help of a Samsung Smart plug), preheat your oven, and ensure your dishes in your dishwasher are clean or dirty. All you need is your voice and a mobile device. When new technology innovations are introduced to the market they receive traction from enthusiastic techies that want the latest gadgets. My experience at the Amazon Echo Alexa Smart Home Pop-up Shop was positive as it gave me an opportunity to really understand how technology can be integrated into my daily life and home. However, in making my home SMART with Amazon Echo, I think need to ask “Alexa” a couple of questions. 1. Is having a SMART home a novelty or a necessity? 2. What does Amazon do with my data? 3. Do I want to share my life with Amazon- Alexa 24 hours a day? Will you be making your home SMART with Amazon Echo?",Shelby,https://medium.com/@shelbyirwin?source=post_page---byline--94f82ae2dd3---------------------------------------,0,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*yLcPjIUoyy4Jm-RUp0kOJg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*yLcPjIUoyy4Jm-RUp0kOJg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*yLcPjIUoyy4Jm-RUp0kOJg.jpeg,2019-01-03T16:40:26.557Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@defcon201/you-are-technical-and-so-is-everyone-else-7ac028428df8?source=tag_archive---------145-----------------------,"You Are Technical, And So Is Everyone Else",Written byDCG 201,"DCG 201 Follow -- Listen Share You Are Technical, And So Is Everyone Else Part of why we founded DEFcon 201 is to combat misplaced notions surrounding Technology and a person being “Technical”. Every now and again, I will meet someone who describes themselves as a non-technical person. This is in fact not true. All people are in fact technical. Everything from flipping a lightswitch to driving a car is in fact a technical operation. Most people use cellphones, computers, the internet, automobiles. Even those that do not, used previous generations of machines like typewriters, faxes, phones, and bicycles. These are all machines with histories. Engineered constructions. Its always been like this. The very concept of civilization is a society and social evolution around machines and engineering. All known human societies are in fact known to use construct and use tools. It is noted by the peoeple who study as such as a common defining element of humanity. To us there is nothing greater to be more in touch with the human spirit than to understand and have agency of the tools we use, and define our lives. Be it computers and phones, or even automobiles, trains, and radios. Some people have noted that others do in fact seek and master a greater understanding of the engineering in their surroundings than others. There is a misplaced shroud of secrecy and mythos surrounding these seekers and the machines they operate. It is the mission of our group invite the public to gain a better understanding and knowledge of the machines already in their lives that they use and depend on. For gaining knowledge and capaiblities in such system is to give agency, we aruge that it be the right of all peoples and persons to be able to understand such technology around them, as well as pursue technology to enrich and better their own lives. We, at DC201 urge you to be more technical, to get in touch with the machines around you, you depend on, and with it. We are here to help. - GI Jack, Co-Founder, DC201",DCG 201,,1,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*839jtw0DxgBEob2FG03lIg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*839jtw0DxgBEob2FG03lIg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*839jtw0DxgBEob2FG03lIg.png,2019-01-02T02:43:41.885Z,Medium

What started as an experiment is now a leading center at the intersection of government, technology, security, and media. Last year, our research and reporting spread over five continents. The community of#DigitalSherlocks— both at the Atlantic Council and across the world — grew stronger and better equipped to keep up the fight for facts. In an era when truth is rarely self-evident, we cannot assume our own credibility and worked to earn your trust and support. Throughout 2018, we were thankful for it. We set out to do something different to solve a collective challenge. We based our work on the simple principle that objective fact is an indispensable foundation of government for and by people. We deployed open-source investigation and digital technologies not only to counter disinformation but also to bolster our core set of values. To celebrate, we present our “top ten” from 2018. In the new year, we will keep at it. While those who would seek to undermine democratic institutions will continue to adapt and evolve, so will we. The facts are on our side. We hope you’ll join us. JULY 31 Facebook Uncovers Active Influence OperationAnalysis of accounts suspended by Facebook for inauthentic behavior surrounding politics in the United States. In 2018,@DFRLabexpanded our#ElectionWatchwork to twelve national and local elections on four continents. We did so as part of an effort to provide independent and credible research on social media’s role in elections and, more broadly, democracy. A sustained focus of#ElectionWatchwas the U.S. midterms. On July 31, Facebook suspended a number of assets for “inauthentic activity.” An initial scan showed the accounts produced coordinated content to set Americans against one another and included behavioral patterns and use of language reminiscent of the troll operations run from Russia in 2014 through 2017. Facebook shared eight pages with@DFRLab24 hours before the takedown. Within that timeframe, our team produced an initial assessment, then followed up with three in depth reports on different aspects of the operation. Russian Traces in Facebook Takedown(Part One: Assessing the origins of “inauthentic” accounts); Russian Traces in Facebook Takedown(Part Two: Influence operation sought to translate online engagement to real world action); and Russian Traces in Facebook Takedown(Part Three: How the trolls tried to cover their tracks). What was clear from this and subsequent disinformation during the midterms was foreign interference in the United States didn’t stop in 2016, but demonstrated evolving tactics over time and adapted to increased scrutiny.READMORE → SEPTEMBER 24 #BreakingGhoutaAn investigation revealing the deliberate destruction of eastern Ghouta, Syria. From February 18 through April 8, a total of 16,934 documented strikes by the Assad regime and its Russian backers hit eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held enclave outside of Damascus. Over 49 days, an average of 345.6 per day rained down on areas without regard for whether combatants or civilians were hit. On February 21, 2018, the heaviest day of attacks in eastern Ghouta, 1,658 strikes were recorded. The majority of these attacks used traditional weaponry. However, some attacks included: Five verified uses of chemical weapons; At least 25 documented uses of incendiary weapons; Credible reports of cluster munitions dropped on at least five days of the siege; And two attacks on hospitals treating civilians. Of the civilians that survived, 66,369 people were forced from their homes. Meanwhile, Assad — using any means — gained momentum and consolidated control over the southern front of the seven-year conflict in Syria. We assembled a team of open-source researchers and investigative journalists to expose the facts on the ground in the latest atrocities committed against Syrian civilians in eastern Ghouta.READMORE → JANUARY 19 Fake News: Defining and DefeatingReal techniques for identifying fake news and disinformation. Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to present his media critics with so-called “fake news awards,” it was more important than ever to define what “fake news” actually is and what it is not. President Trump’s repeated accusations of fake news are dangerous both for journalists around the world and for the integrity of free and fair democratic discourse in America. At the beginning of the year,@DFRLabstopped using the term “fake news,” instead opting for our working definitions of disinformation and misinformation. The work of the community to counter disinformation grew throughout the year. Nearly 11 months later, dictionary.com named “misinformation” the word of the year.READMORE → MARCH 30 How To Spot Russian TrollsSome clues which identify probable Kremlin accounts. Since Russia’s attempt to polarize American society and interfere in the 2016 election was exposed, and even more since the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom, accusations of being a “Russian troll” have proliferated online, often with the flimsiest of evidence. Such accusations do more harm than good, obscuring the ways in which trolls can be verifiably identified and increasing online polarization within democracies. In the interests of transparency and reasoned debate, this post listed some of the factors that can be used to identify possible Russian trolls masquerading as citizens of other countries.READMORE → AUGUST 15 Loves For Sale in BrazilExposing a Brazilian network which trades clicks for cash.

On October 17, Twitter released an archive of over 10 million tweets posted by accounts from 2013 through 2018. Of the total, over 9 million tweets were attributable to 3,800 accounts affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, also known as Russia’s St. Petersburg troll factory. Over 1 million tweets were attributable to 770 accounts, originating from Iran. Each set is included in the same archive; however, because the actors and activity were separate, our analysis was conducted accordingly. In an effort to promote shared understanding of the vulnerabilities exploited by various types on online influence operations, as well as social media’s role in democracy,@DFRLabhad a brief advance opportunity to analyze the nearly complete archive.READMORE → AUGUST 23 New Russian Electronic Warfare Systems in Eastern UkraineMonitors find recently-developed complexes on the wrong side of the Russo-Ukrainian border. A brand-new electronic warfare system which the Russian Armed Forces brought into service this year was identified in eastern Ukraine, along with several other modern systems. The sighting underlined a significant escalation and Russia’s increasing attempts to prevent drone-based monitoring of the conflict in Ukraine. It provided yet more proof of Russia’s ongoing military involvement in the conflict in its western neighbor, and its continued investment in attempts to mask that involvement. Over the past four years, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine has observed and photographed a number of Russian electronic warfare (EW) systems in the conflict area. These systems are known to have targeted the SMM’s drones, hindering the monitoring group’s ability to observe violations of the Minsk accords. We took a closer look.READMORE → APRIL 20 Bots Target Malaysian Elections17,000 bots target Malaysian opposition party ahead of the General Elections on May 9. Our#ElectionWatchwork spanned four continents in 2018 from local elections inMoldovato national elections in Mexico. The furthest our coverage reached was Malaysia, where a tip ahead of general elections revealed a great deal of automated content. Twitter bots launched two hashtag campaigns promoting #SayNOtoPH and #KalahkanPakatan (translation from Malay: Defeat Pakatan). Pakatan Harapan (PH) is currently Malaysia’s ruling coalition. The two hashtags — #SayNOtoPH and #KalahkanPakatan — were used 44,100 times by 17,600 Twitter users, the majority of which were bots. The campaign reached more than 300,000 users and generated more than half a million impressions. It is hard to say how many of those impressions came from real users considering the bots behind the campaign had very few followers, most of which were other bots.READMORE → MARCH 10 Tributes to Russian Mercenaries from Ukraine to SyriaTracking Russian mercenary statues erected in Syria and Ukraine. On February 22, the first images of a statue dedicated “to Russian volunteers” (российским добровольцам) in Luhansk appeared on Russian social media platform VKontakte. This monument appeared to be an exact copy of a statue erected outside of Palmyra in Syria as early as January 2018. Furthermore, both statues had a military insignia similar to the “Wagner Cross” of the infamous Russian Wagner Group mercenaries (Группа Вагнера). Both Syria and Ukraine are known locations in which Wagner mercenaries operate for hire. The Wagner Group is believed to be funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has a been included in our reporting on security issues in Ukraine, Syria, andLibya. Prigozhin wasindicted in the United Statesdue to the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation findings for his alleged support of the Internet Research Agency. He also is subject to economic sanctions by the United States.READMORE → FEBRUARY 23 Banks, Bribes, and Alleged Latvian LaunderersWhat we do and do not know about reports of corruption against the president of the Bank of Latvia. On February 19, the Associated Press published an article by journalist Carlo Piovano, which alleged Ilmars Rimsevics, Governor of the Bank of Latvia and a Latvian member of the European Central Bank (ECB), was the central figure of a bribery scandal and protected money launderers. Rimkevics was also photographed sitting by a table with Dmitry Pilshchikov, who was then the head of the Russian Research Institute of Information Technology (НИИИТ— NIIIT). The aim of the image was to illustrate Rimsevic’s ties with a Russian elite. Ahead of the Latviangeneral elections, the story was at the heart of political conversations in both Latvian and Russian.READMORE → We’re just getting started and have much more planned for 2019.

The Occasion Marked the near 50% Tipping Point for Global Internet Access and 70 Years Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. www.peoplecentered.net Archive of theLivestream available online with subtitles. Visual Journal by Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood, Visual Insight A historic event scaling the vision for the People-Centered Internet coalition was held on December 10, 2018 by Ray Wang, Founder of Constellation Research, who worked closely with Dr. David Bray, Executive Director for PCI. It was a moment in time coinciding with these milestones: 50 percent of people in the world now officially connected to the Internet The United Nations marks the 70thanniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights 50 years since Dr. Douglas Engelbart created the “Mother of all Demos” showing the first computer mouse, hyperlinking, videoconferencing and other inventions that foreshadowed the era of personal computing. Among thespeakerswere People Centered Internet (PCI) founders Dr. Vinton G. Cerf and Mei Lin Fung, Dr. David Bray and Marci Harris, Executive Director and Board Treasurer for PCI respectively, Constellation Research CEO Ray Wang, World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee, semantic web visionary Dame Wendy Hall, iconic technology designer Joy Mountford, former President of Estonia Toomas Ilves and Ieva Ilves, authors Doc Searls and Joy Searls, along with other luminaries. The event was a marathon series of panel discussions ontopicsranging from the future of the Internet and the ethical challenges of Artificial Intelligence to Data Ownership and Human Rights. Here, we’ll share some highlights, insights and soundbites that emerged from the day, captured in murals created live by Visual Insight’s Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood. We will also share some of the photos taken by PCI volunteer Bill Daul. Background Vint Cerf — inventor of the TCP/IP protocols enabling the Internet along with Bob Kahn in 1973 — has devoted the past four decades to finding ways that the Internet can serve humanity by linking people around the globe in a supportive network. In 2014, he joined forces with Mei Lin Fung — who worked closely with Dr. Engelbart on networked improvement communities — to create the nonprofit People-Centered Internet organization (PCI). CEO Ray Wang, Founder of Constellation Research, worked with Dr. David Bray, Executive Director for the People-Centered Internet coalition, to organize a Team of Constellation personnel and volunteers to produce the December 10 conference and gala to garner international support for PCI’s vision for an Internet that measurably improves people’s lives and livelihoods around the globe. Special thanks extended to everyone at Constellation Research (notably Meghan O’Neill Ruona, Aubrey Coggins, and Dennis Kanemitsu) as well as to Marci Harris, Stephanie Wander, Corina DuBois, Tricia Wang, Inna Bagoli, and Felix Velarde. Also thank you to the Internet Society, Joly MacFie, and Cory Strandberg for helping with thevideos and interactions. Welcome “We’ve got this 50–50 moment,”declared Tim Berners-Lee, referring to the milestone declared by the ITU, the United Nations agency for information and communications technology — that 3.9 billion, half the people on the planet, are now connected to the Internet. “The Web can be there for humanity…It’s all about the individual,”said Berners-Lee, who created the Web Foundation in order to “make sure we get the Web we want.” Mei Lin Fung talked about unleashing thepower of technology for good,making the Internet beneficial in ways specific to individual and community needs. Vint Cerf honored the memory of Doug Engelbart with the reminder that the famous December 9, 1968 Demo was inspired by a desire to improve people’s lives. Cerf called on people tofocus on the hope and the vision for the Internet, instead of their fears. International Perspectives and Future of the Internet by Early Pioneers Dame Wendy Hall called on the assemblage to focus on another 50–50 statistic.“Women are 50 percent of the Internet,”she said, emphasizing the need to include more women in decisions about the Internet — and the world — moving forward. She expressed hope and concern about a future with “social networks on steroids.” She expressed worry about children in an era where the Internet is being attacked and manipulated but hope for levelling the opportunity landscape.“We are bringing the world to the table,”she said. She cautioned against relying too heavily on software to make decisions that should be made by humans. Cerf, Berners-Lee, and Hall as a panel discussed what the future might hold. The group cautioned about upcoming complexity with the Internet of Things(“what if your fridge digitally attacks someone?”) and the need for people to control their own data. Governing the Internet / 70 Years of Human Rights The former president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrick Ilves, declaredthe biggest problem on the Internet today: digital interference in elections.He talked about a positive earlier governance event that was initiated by people rather than governments — the “Arab Spring” uprising of people against oppressive governments in 2011. Then political manipulation by Russia followed. He suggested looking to the EU’s approach to Internet governance emphasizing freedom and responsibility rather China’s repression orSilicon Valley’s laissez free-for-all. Perspective from history came from Scott Campbell, Senior Human Rights Officer for the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Hunan Rights, who said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be invoked today to help us deal with problems eerily similar to those that shook the world when the documentwas written in 1948: disinformation, hate speech, destruction and the Holocaust. How can we insure “never again”?Commitment to the fundamental conviction that “all people are born free and equal.” Building Human Rights / The Internet & Human Rights Distributed ledgers emerged as a proposed solution to guaranteeing what’s being called the31sthuman right: The right to our own data. Richie Etwaru called on people to become “courage agents” supporting network agreements the enable people to own their data. Then, members of the panel on the Internet & Human Rights raised a call for faster action if the Internet is to hold to the original hope as a place of connection, imagination and self-expression. Will technology interfere with those human rights or enhance them?“The decisions we make today will be with us for a long time.” Remedying Disinformation / Free from Fear / Internet Growing Pains Multiple panelists concluded that it’s up to all of us to grow“a digital world where truth can survive.”Among the branches are: New approaches — with good intentions, humility and government working together with industry Safety — with user education, ways torate the accuracy of information,andinclusion of children’s needs; Attention to unfinished work — ethics, awareness that all information tends to persist Identity — focus on privacy Education — listening and making commitments/agreements to care about the next generation’s safety and well-being. PCI’s David Bray moderated a panel of Ilves, Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the ITU, and Alex Gladstein from the Human Rights Foundation on the challenges that theInternet presents to societies and pluralistic co-existence, to include the need for guidelines for corporations. Smarter Cities & Digital Heartlands / Digital Inclusion This is the era of cities with 70 per cent of people living in urban areas, whilerural areas are less connected and more vulnerable.Populations including Native Americans and countries including Africa are not being served by the Internet. Right now, it’s important to look for“cultural hotspots” where people aren’t connected. This is where People Centered Internet can have real impact. We need to get the policies right — government must get involved — and stay focused on serving people regardless of their financial resources. It’s a problem that“when money gets involved, different people are served.” “Think of the Internet as a basic utility.”That way, finances are not the determinant of who has access. World of A.I. / Shared Prosperity Artificial Intelligence will bring a wave of challenges and opportunity.The emerging technologies should be considered ways to augment — not replace — human capacity. They can enhance the mundane with innovation, creativity and personalization. Butwe must balance the risk with how A.I. can meet our needs. Inclusive growth requires real time data + better decisions + a clearer picture + peer-to-peer analysis. Both PCI’s David Bray and Salesforce’s John Taschek emphasized a vision for technology-enhancing prosperity that requires welead with empathy and scale our personal morals into social ethics.Most problems are a failure in communication. The Internet and Whole Human Health / Open and Personal Data Sets The People-Centered Internet starts with the individual, and the most basic need for the individual is health.Individual health can be enhanced by data in context. “We are all digital beings now” andeach of us could be a “data donor.” Via sensors, we can, if we want to, contribute information that enables research to deliver better healthcare. Our health data — and all our data —can better serve us if we have a personal dashboard enabling us to access it.But we need to be cautious at a time when “the Internet knows more about me than I know about myself.” Education / Community Resilience / Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure “Technology was thrust on education.” While can continue to try experiments to make it work within the current educational structure in the U.S., there are barriers. “The only firewall bigger than China’s is public education.” Imagine a world where public education embraced the capacity of the Internet.“What if we could be more portable with our learning?” For students the potential is endless: “Technology connects us with the world.” On the topic of Community Resilience, we heard a call to work from the ground up — using technology to create a local alert and multi-alert network. High definition cameras can help us anticipate disasters — seeing fires before they rage out of control.Instead of bouncing back — we can bounce forward. Accessibility for All / Mural Nets / Trust Mariel Triggs described how accessibility is occurring on tribal lands with new libraries and access to education. The engine that will run these networks is trust.“The DNA for the future needs to have trust at the core.” Safeguarding digital infrastructure matters as we increasingly become dependent on the Internet. Already we have proven models at the community level, but for partnerships to scale, we need government to focus on fostering — not simply regulating — partnerships.“Developing trust is good business.”Elements of trust are transparency and a long view of the future. A.I. and Human Lives, the Internet and Corporate Responsibility Artificial intelligence transforms our lives, yet panelists raised caution about aspects ofhuman intelligence that might not be replicated, the potential for bias baked into the box, and the need for ethics.Joy Mountford raised a laugh from the crowd, then said, “hopefully you’ll see the humor in things the computer cannot.” How can we motivate corporate responsibility?One idea was to have a seal for best practices.Moderators continually invoked another method — peer pressure, calling out companies who have had failures in responsibility, and praising those that demonstrated responsibility The Future of Work and Social Impact Looking at the future of work in the context of the Internet, panelists notedthe biggest problem is that people do not feel safe online.If we are to achieve a truly people-centric Internet, thelocus of control must move from corporations to individuals;individuals need protection. If these problems can be addressed and good decisions are made today, technology will augment rather than eliminate jobs. We are likely to have a new definition of work and new social contract that benefits workers. The social impact of the Internet balances risk and freedom— a balance that can be hard to understand because there are so many variables we cannot predict. The day closed with a reflection fromVint Cerf on the future aheadand a motivation for everyone to visitwww.peoplecentered.netand sign-up both for the newsletter and to indicate what they can do as positive change agents in the world.

https://medium.com/@herewegoo/four-lessons-from-2018-43fcbd8bd05a?source=tag_archive---------147-----------------------,Four Lessons from 2018,Written byDaniel,"Daniel Follow -- Listen Share A quick one. 2019 or bust. The next time you receive a random dirty look from a stranger on the street, or someone says your clothes look weird, look at/think about the list. Not on the list? Don’t care.This is from an article I can’t find but do remember really well. If anyone recognises it please hit me up with a source so I can credit the original author. We’ve all probably heard in some way form or another that Social Media is ruining our mental health, and too often we need to be “available” for people and we need to“reply in good time”. When focusing on a task or something at work this past year, it seemed easier than ever for me to switch off and get distracted and open up Facebook or Reddit for a quick browse. If a message pops up on Android as a heads-up notification it’s immediately there, and in your face. I’ve started swiping them up or away as they are just so intrusive. I guess now it’s time to just turn them off for good. If you want you can go to the extreme and just place your phone on silent for good, with perhaps the option of including exceptions for calls from the most important people in your life. Phones are amazing devices but the way that they operate as well as all social media distraction sinkholes is to get and then keep your attention. That’s why I’veremoved suggested videos from YouTubeand muted most notifications on the few social apps installed. I’vekilled the Facebook news feedfrom pretty much every device I own and resorted to using Chrome on my phone if I want to see what’s on there. Every time I do check it I ask myself why I did as the memes and news articles are novel for about a minute and I close the tab. And I’m slowly warming to the idea of deleting Facebook itself by the end of the year. Something we can all start to think about, which is essentially the essence of minimalism — you probably own a lot of old stuff in boxes or cupboards that you don’t actually need.Is this souvenir improving your life in any way? Is this cool packaging box for this tablet really needed in your life? Throw them out.Do you wear these old clothes anymore? Wow, phyiscal copies of computer games you last played 7 years ago? Are you ever going to read this book you got as a gift? Donate them to charity. Maybe recycle the clothes. Because we all know you’re probably just buying more and more stuff each day anyway, and your room is probably not as tidy or organised as it could be. Most people can be reasoned with. I would always suggest a sensible dialouge where people try to understand disagreements and maybe find a common ground. Some people can’t, and once you’ve hit a certain point where no progress is being made, where the other party refuses to listen or care, move on. It is no longer worth exerting any effort or thought — it’s not about giving up, it’s about choosing your battles and doing it wisely. Have a great new year everyone.

Google Earth Follow Google Earth and Earth Engine -- Listen Share By Brian Ellis, Tech Lead, Google Earth When welaunchedthe Measure Tool in Google Earth, you told us that, while you enjoyed measuring the area ofFasta Åland(685 square kilometers), the footprint of theTaj Mahal Garden(17 hectares), and the perimeter ofMachu Picchu(1,460 meters), you needed more flexibility. Some of you work with maritime navigation and aeronautics, some of you need to measure long distances with high precision, and some of you (like me!) just have really strong opinions on the whole “meters versus feet” thing. We heard you, and your feedback has made the Measure Tool even better. Now you can pick from the same wide variety of distance and area units you may know from Google Earth Pro — including nautical miles, both feetandmeters, and yes, even the venerablesmoot. Just use the Measure Tool to measure a distance or area, then click or tap on the result to convert it into different units. Selecting “automatic” will choose units for you based on the distance or area you’re measuring, whether your country uses metric or imperial units, and your preferences. We hope this change will give you more power to go measure more things, like the distance fromTokyo to Manila(1,617 nautical miles), the size of theChoctaw nation(2,813,763 hectares), and the footprint ofLondon’s Hyde Park(350 acres).

https://medium.com/@eurocoinpay/how-blockchain-makes-life-easier-for-us-95217999fe9b?source=tag_archive---------149-----------------------,How Blockchain makes our life easier ?,Written byEurocoinPay.io,"EurocoinPay.io Follow -- Listen Share The path since the appearance of Bitcoin Blockchain, it’s been a long way since the Bitcoin developed and counterparts appear to capture the attention of the global masses and financial industry. Blockchain guarantees traceability If we look at the distribution chain as we know it, it has multiple actors and steps involved that are almost always at very distant points. It is necessary to carry out multiple procedures and formalities of all kinds (departures, transports, imports, traceability, deliveries, invoicing, etc.) which for their guarantee require adequate follow-up. For the most part, companies and organisations do not offer transparency in this sense and even manipulate it. Blockchain is presented as the real solution for the digitalization of the supply chain. Traceabilityis synonymous with knowing the origin of a product and being able to follow its course in the different steps of the transformation and distribution chain, without being manipulated.With Blockchain it´s programmable, reliable and allows to obtain information in real timewith operations carried out . What for? In order to be able to act as quickly as possible in the event of an incident. These characteristics turn it as aguarantee of quality for the companies, especially in the food industry. We have seen it in the campaign for a large supermarket in Spain. The inviolability of Blockchain gives a much more convincing value. With the adoption of Blockchain, the stakeholders in the chain cannot alter it, since it is insured and jointly owned by several entities. In fact, contains information is more than reliable and cannot be questioned as it isn’t managed by a single actor that may have economic or political interests. It allows interested parties to gain operational efficiency, and above allto gain brand image in the eyes of consumers. Blockchain and the Cryptocurrencies When we talk about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies, we have to say that they are means of exchange like any other currency, the natural evolution of Fiat money to cryptocurrency, but the great difference is that the cryptocurrenciesdoes not depend on any Central Bank or Governmentthat controls their issuance. They have a value in traditional currencies: can be exchanged for dollars, euros or any other currency at any time, what’s more, you are able to to trade with cryptocurrencies and make the conversion to Fiat money and vice versa. The participants can use it across the multiple platforms, globally. The incorporation of Bitcoin as a means of payment An alternative that is increasingly present in the street as a means of payment is that among the reasons why the popularity of the Cryptocurrency has increased considerably. First of allits safety, economical, decentralize andwithout intermediaries. Eurocoinpay, is a platform that is working to integrate traditional financial systems, which are currently in need of disruptive solutions such as Blockchain, and find niche market,seeking trust in societyand government institutions and create value synergies for both in a friendlier world. State of the market for Cryptocurrency We could talk about euphoria if we had joined the cryptocurrency market a few years ago, with an investment of one hundred euros invested in Bitcoin, at that time. Today we would have in our portfolio more than five million euros. On the contrary, those who did so in the end of 2017 are in a panic situation with significant losses after the market has made a major adjustment. The current moment is good. Now the market is developed and demanded, projects that are behind the crypto models bring significant value to society, investors have a lot of information available on each project and we must ensure that projects are real and not speculative. But be careful, in this sector there is a lot of intruder taking advantage of the little knowledge that the investors have in search of the high economic returns that there were in previous years, existing a high percentage of fraud. Is simple to join to world of cryptocurrencies, it only takes a few clicks and does not require great knowledge of economics, but the rationality and pragmatism. Many people have found in this sector a way to make small monthly contributions, with micro-investments in the medium and long term, but not investing, or putting at risk more than what we are willing to lose at a given time and above all that is does not gravely affect our economy.",EurocoinPay.io,,50,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*ILmNN_dcwa5A-xILNf_eJg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ILmNN_dcwa5A-xILNf_eJg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ILmNN_dcwa5A-xILNf_eJg.png,2019-01-02T18:08:54.023Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@rwxrob/where-do-you-want-to-work-3cf03f3ae61a?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,Where Do You Want to Work?,Written byRob Muhlestein,"Rob Muhlestein Follow -- 1 Listen Share “Which technology should I learn?”is one of the hardest questions any technologist must answer. It is also the most important. With the pace of innovation and change today hesitating for a moment is likely to put youwaybehind your competition. Specialists get hired and paid more, not generalists. In a field likewebdevelopment this risk is even greater. Fortunately there is a rather simple method of determining the answer:decide what you want to do with you life. Simple to say, hard do do, but probably not as hard as you think. Today I was working with a student trying to make this decision himself. We briefly discussed all of the following and how they all fit together: serverless, lambda, JAMstack, devops, containers, system administration, elastic services hosting, continuous integration, microservices, front-end web development, back-end web development, full-stack web development, deep-end development, continuous security auditing, server patching, enterprise change management. That isn’t even close to covering everything. We live in a time when there is so much tech to choose from that even knowing what is out there is a full-time job. How is anyone — especially a beginner — going to know which path to take? This can get very frustrating even for the most experienced veterans. The web people coined the term “framework fatigue” for that feeling of being constantly bombarded with new stuff that they have to master and integrate into their projects to be current. The key to answering this question is knowing what you want to do — not just with your life — but with every hour of the day while you are alive. What are thespecificactivities that you enjoy? Do you like people? Do you live for the terminal and typing on a keyboard all day? Are you more of a graphics person? Do you need to move more than the minimum to stay alive? Do you enjoy solving problems? Is putting out fires more of your thing than building something that could potentially cause a fire? Are you good with your hands and like working with gadgets? How good are you at visualizing things? There are hundreds more questions that any sort of career guidance survey will have, but here are some that I realized today I have never seen anywhere. I’m starting to think they matter even more than all the others: Do you like the idea of working for a big organization? Do you prefer a small, start-up feel? Are you comfortable working gig to gig on contracts? How mobile are you truly? Do you absolutely need to go into an office with peers? How much money do youreallyneed? How important is influence to you? Would you be good just doing what you are told? Will you be miserable unless youknowwhat you are doing will make a difference that matters to you? Do you have people depending on you? What company would meet their needs best? These questions identify the type of company you would enjoy and therefore where you would most likely do your best work. It is easier to know what tech to learn when you know what type of company you wish to work for — or even better — the top 10 companies you specifically would love to work for if you could apply today. Your answers will change dramatically over time. When I was in college I knew that being a river guide or cruise director was not going to be a profession I could do for a long time — especially later with a family. I did know I had to do it then if at all of I would never be able to do it again. What does that have to do with what tech to learn? It meant thatI dropped techfor a while and learned everything I could about wilderness first-aid, survival, fitness, and the outdoors. Knowing the job I wanted changedallmy learning priorities dramatically, so much so that learninganytech would have distracted me from my specialty in that job. Later the web came out. Remember that? No one believed me when I told them it was going to be huge, no one, not even my wife at the time. She tolerated my rants about how big it was going to be. “One day you will see these web addresses on the sides of buses and every television show!” I knew I wanted to be involved however I could but there were no companies that dealt with that stuff, until there were. I called Xmission in Salt Lake City, Utah who provided my PPP dial-up connection to the Internet. I knew I wanted to work for a company like it but had no idea what I needed to learn. I will never forget the day I called and the engineer I managed to get on the phone spent some time discussing it with me. I asked him one specific question without any real fore-thought. The answer was perhaps the most important bit of information of my career. “I realize I’m not ready to apply to your company right now, but would you mind telling me one thing I could learn that would make you hire me immediately?” “Learn Perl,” he said. I had already been doing HTML before there were books on it having seen it come out in college. This advice was different than learning about the next coolest tech. It was specifically the greatest skill needed by my #1 pick for a company to work for. I bought “Learn Perl in 21 Days” and did just that. I remember reading in my ship cabin with my pregnant, patient wife in the other bunk while still working on the cruise ship in Russia. I installed Perl on my mac and hacked around with it making little programs and doing the assignments. Messing around with a thing is always the best way to learn. Learning is messy. It’s just a fact. Because I had already learned HTML and had learned more Perl than anyone within probably 50 miles I was ready when a similar company opened up literally next to my apartment, FiberNet. When I walked in I was ready. They hired be practically on the spot. I became the Director of Sales as well as the Webmaster. I coded the first open form-to-mail processing service calledfb.plin Perl and quickly learned how to tweak it and build other CGI scripts. All of this tech is way out of date now The point is that because I had envisioned and even called the company I wanted to work for asking them what skills they needed above all else — without any false pretense, pride, or agenda — I was ready when an opportunity at an identical company emerged. So toyouI say again identify the companies you envision yourself working at. Then do all the research you can — even interview engineers and hiring managers — about the needs ofthatcompany. Most companies will be flattered to learn how much you have researched about them before even making the call. Reach out to friends and family that you know that work at the company or one like it. Identify specific individuals who work at those companies and stalk them on Twitter to hear everything about what they do. Twitter is for who youwantto know. [Facebook is for who you knew.] Get recruiters involved in helping you make this happen. In thegig economyeveryone needs an agent. Find one. As soon as you identify a few companies isolate their biggest needs to two or threespecifictechnologies. Then divedeeplyinto them and don’t come up for air. Master them. Produce a lot of tangible proof that you know them. Become absolutely indispensible. Do it as quickly because the need will likely change in a few months and be something new. Don’t worry. You can always ask again and adjust your learning plan. Unless you are learning code to build your own company or have fun making your own stuffyour primary goal in learning any tech skill is to bring value to your employer.It is remarkable how many beginners lose sight of this focus, even after they are hired. It is not about learning and using cool tech, it is about adding value. For example, if you want to work for a bigger organization such as a bank or multi-national not-for-profit you are likely going to be forced to learn very old technology. It is pretty much a law of physics that unless you are talking about a tech giant a large company is going to still be using things like AIX, PHP, and gobs and gobs of Java. I remember one vice president telling me how proud they were of their Ruby on Rails project. I once told our engineering lead at Nike about Linux only to have him put it down, forget about it, and — a year later — approach me toaskif I would be ok if they changed the Solaris machine hosting Nike’s Intranet into a Linux server. I did not have the heart to remind him. I often have to explain to students that I am forced to pick from among emerging technologies that I feel will be cresting, surfable waves by the time they enter the work force. So far I have nailed it, most prominently with calling Go as a leading DevOps language five years ago about the same time we threw out coding in Java for Python, which is the fastest growing language in the world by all indicators at the moment. More recently we have moved to learning web applications development with modern JavaScript, the most popular language on the planet. We don’t spend any time learning Swift or Kotlin because frankly those technologies are on the way out with native mobile development in Native Script, Ionic, and React Native. The entire concept of anapp storeis under fire and even litigation at the moment. The future is offline-first progressive web apps and native web app frameworks on the front-end side of things. That writing is very clearly on the wall to anyone looking up at it. Still, one of my best students is currently on a paid internship where he is essentially forced to use Python Flask where a microservice in Go would be a far superior solution. [By the way, to my surprisemost Python development isstillback-end web applicationsandnotdata science related.] The company employing him has certain considerations that require this decision. When you are an intern you get to work for some companies you might not pick for yourself. That helps you make the decision. Another big company down the road, Duke, notably hired a lot of Go developers recently. “But I only want to program in Go.” That would be me, for the most part. Although picking the type of company you want to work for the best to help beginners decide which tech to learn another approach — usually later in life — is to survey a lot of tech and pick what you absolutely love. Then find that companies that employ people who are good at it. This approach is more difficult because you have to be willing to work wherever the work is that pays for your preferred tech skill. Take game development, for example. Developing a video game in Phaser or Unreal Engine is a skill only a very specific set of companies are hiring for and those that do are very competitive. This is not unlike wanting to become a performer. If all you want to do is perform you have to be prepared to take whatever work you can doing it — initially.

https://medium.com/@DonBasile/graphene-prosthetics-and-the-cyberpunk-future-f28d2715bc32?source=tag_archive---------150-----------------------,Graphene prosthetics and the cyberpunk future,Written byDon Basile,"Don Basile Follow -- Listen Share Within science fiction, particularly the subgenre known as cyberpunk, humans augment themselves with various technological devices and prosthetics to enhance themselves beyond human capabilities, or to repair themselves in ways that perfectly replicate body functions. So how do modern prosthetics fare compared to the technological marvels of fiction? While we have made huge leaps forward in bionics andmyoelectrics, we are not quite yet at the level of the cyberpunk future. But with graphene, we may just be able to get there. The material’s strength, light weight, and endless utility could lead to even more dramatic advancements in prosthetic technology. In modern prosthetics,bionic limbshave done excellently in replicating movement and function of missing body parts for amputees, offering mostly full range of motion for legs, feet, arms, and hands. This can be contributed to the development of myoelectric sensors, which connect the artificial limb to the natural electrical processes generated by muscles in order to enable complex movement. Hand prosthetics in particular have made major advancements in replicating the intricate and specific motor functions of fingers. Our advancements in prosthetics make it so that we can successfully regain lost function, but still lack meaningful tactile perception. While some might argue that the absence of pain is a benefit, the use of touch to perceive potentially harmful stimuli to the host would be a valuable addition to the features prosthetics provide, not to mention the emotional and psychological relief that may come with such upgrades to prosthetic tech. This is where graphene can step in. Scientists have begun to use the wonder material to create agraphene-based skinfor prosthetics. This e-dermis electrically stimulates the amputee’s nerves non-invasively through the skin, replicating the process of signal relaying that the brain utilizes in tactile feeling. In addition, graphene’s optical transparency allows for 98% of light to pass through it, making the perfect material toutilize solar energyto power these advanced prosthetics. Of course, pain is not the only feeling that this graphene skin would allow users to process, and it’s potential to make the feeling from phantom limbs a reality again is truly wondrous to behold. Even more intricate, graphene can potentially be used to create smallimplantsand internal prostheses that would be capable of correcting eyesight or hearing, to repair the body and help in overcoming degenerative diseases, or even help mend broken bones. Previously, silicon-based implants were too damaging to internal tissues if disturbed, and the conditions inside the body damaged the electronic components. However, graphene’s strength, being 200 times stronger than steel, and its flexibility make it much more durable. It is also possible to use graphene to create transistors that are gated by the natural fluids surrounding the implant. With graphene, the hyper-advanced technological developments of cyberpunk are closer than ever. With graphene, prosthetics are on the cusp of reaching the technological heights of science fiction. Like with many graphene-based products, they are mostly in the testing and research phase, but it’s clear that the application of graphene can bring about a new era in the field of prosthetics and change countless lives.

https://medium.com/re-write/5-career-lessons-from-designers-at-the-worlds-best-companies-a98ec8a3a2f7?source=tag_archive---------63-----------------------,5 Career Lessons from Designers at the World’s Best Companies,We asked designers and creatives from some of the world’s best companies about their biggest career lessons.,"We asked designers and creatives from some of the world’s best companies about their biggest career lessons. CMCI Studio Follow RE: Write -- Listen Share CMCI Studiois a design graduate program at CU Boulder. Established in 2009, the program has been developing design leaders for nearly a decade. Our alumni have gone on to design and lead teams at Google, Apple,Spotify,Uber, Pinterest,Dropbox,Wieden+Kennedy,R/GA, Twitter, Airbnb and more. Many have also founded their own companies and agencies. With so much combined experience in our network, we wanted to know what the last decade has taught them about growing as a creative and building a career in design. Here are their biggest takeaways: 1. Be willing to take control of your own destiny. The most common thread from everyone we spoke to. Waiting for permission often just leaves you waiting. To push new ideas and move forward in your career sometimes you need to take a risk and go for it. Mike Newell, Interactive Dev Manager @ Apple: “Don’t ask for permission to do things, if you have an idea for something, make it. The most successful people I’ve seen in my time have been the ones who just go off and make shit happen. Be smart enough to figure things out and dumb enough to try.” Alia Munger, Product Designer @ Google: “Your career goals will change and morph constantly, be open to it and willing to grow. Evaluate your contributions, role, and impact every year. If it doesn’t align with your values, goals, and needs — find something else. You have a great foundation to create a path unique to you.” Dan Viens, Creative Director @ Wieden + Kennedy: “Don’t assume other people are thinking deeply about your career, your contributions, or your role on a project. It’s great to have mentors, collaborative colleagues and an awesome boss, but even if you have those things you need to take charge of your work, your day and your career. If you have an idea for a project you’re not expected to work on then pitch the idea (Don’t half-ass it. Develop it and share it.) It’s your job to make your voice heard. If you find yourself in an environment where you don’t think your voice can be heard let someone know. If that falls on deaf ears, get out. And when you show up, do it with confidence and without ego. That is a powerful combo.” 2. Be flexible in your approach and always be learning Design work isn’t always the most exciting. But, if you stay open and flexible, and intentionally look for the chances to learn in each project, your work will always push you forward and you’ll never stop improving. Adam Noffsinger, Senior Product Designer @ Dropbox: “In my experience, the designers that are most successful are those that are able to adapt to new tools, workflows, and ways of thinking with relative independence. Designers too often find a way of working or thinking that becomes comfortable, which then leads to stagnation. Just as engineers find themselves consistently moving between new frameworks and languages in order to better solve problems, designers should approach new ways of working with unbridled curiosity.” Patti Lo, Product Designer @ OpenTable: “Always be open to learning. There may be times you work on a problem or feature that isn’t the most exciting thing ever. For those moments, you can still go in with the attitude that you’ll take at least one thing away from the experience.” Alia@ Google: “Not all of your work will be exciting, and a lot of it will be slow going. Finding ways to challenge yourself with your work in those times will be beneficial in so many ways.” 3. Don’t be afraid to put your business hat on As creatives, we can sometimes feel reticent to embrace the business side of what we are creating. But, thinking long-term and stepping into a more strategic role can set you apart and push the quality and impact of your work. Emily McCammon, Founder @ Femme Digital: “You need to be highly strategic and largely medium agnostic. Being strategic does not preclude you from going deep on tools & skills. Specialization can co-exist with agility and strategy.” Joe Toscano⚡️, Designer-Founder @ Designgood.tech: “Business. No matter where you work, you have to understand business. If you don’t know how to get your idea onto the product roadmap, you’re just a dreamer. No ideas ever changed the world, it was people acting on those ideas. If you want people to act on your ideas, they need to drive business.” Pedro Sorrentino, Cofounder & General Partner @ ONEVC: “It pays to combine long-term thinking with a daily sense of urgency.” 4. Be a bridge builder for all your stakeholders We talk about user-centered design, but there are also a lot of other stakeholders to consider in the process of creating great work. A great designer is a bridge between each of these different points of view. CassieStewart, Product Marketer @ Twitter: “It all comes back to empathy. You can have rad design skills and be incredibly innovative with code and yet miss the mark entirely. It’s one thing to build something you think is cool. That’s art, and that’s wonderful and deserves its own place in this world. But when you are building for others,build for others. Put them first and talk to them along the way.” Kate Mills, Lead Product Designer @ Aetna: “One of my biggest lessons is the importance of building relationships with product and engineering partners. I can produce awesome and effective designs for features all day, but if I don’t also collaborate, bring people in, get their buy-in, advocate for the importance of the design process, etc., then I will never be successful at building and executing on long-term UX strategy.” Emma Lawler, Cofounder @ Moonlight: “You need to be a full-stack thinker and implementer who genuinely cares about the users you’re designing for. Engineers, marketers, and product managers all have opinions and great ideas. The specialized design practitioner on the team needs to lead discussions and bring together all the thoughts, priorities, and user needs into a functional end product.” Alia@ Google: “Anyone can learn how to create the perfect drop shadow or transition animation, what I think the industry needs are designers skilled in applying end-to-end emotional design, empathy, and ethics. Designers end up being the [only] voice at the table for a lot of these issues.” 5. Communicate, communicate, communicate It is nearly impossible to get things done if you can’t communicate your vision, your process and the value of your work. Like all things, good communication can be learned with intentional practice. Tory Rebhun, UX Research Lead @ STARZ “Internal business processes and operational collaboration are incredibly important and have a huge impact on your ability to create a great product for the user. In larger organizations, this is tailoring your communication and work to appeal to the user’s needs, but also understanding how to communicate that value to a variety of business stakeholders.” George Tong, Senior Art Director @ Flexport “Presentation matters. In every aspect of your career, you’re going to have to sell yourself and your ideas. Whether it’s an interview or a nationwide campaign, you’re going to need to present, and present well. Think about who you’re presenting to and be intentional about how you’re going to present to them.” Patti@ OpenTable: “Writing! From day-to-day processes like defining user needs and formulating hypotheses, to creating usability tests and putting together presentations, I’m constantly writing. It’s invaluable to be able to effectively articulate the thought that goes into your work. Writing is something that I’m constantly working on.” Joe@ Designgood.tech: “What’s in our minds does not automatically translate to the minds of others. If you have an idea you think should be brought to life, prototype it, make it feel real, show people the vision, have numbers to support it, and create the plan to put it into production. Make it so easy to say yes that they won’t say no.” About CMCI Studio CMCI Studio is a design graduate program at CU Boulder.

https://medium.com/@aidan.reid/the-main-factors-in-growing-a-successful-community-4749a17339c2?source=tag_archive---------169-----------------------,The Main Factors in Growing a Successful Community,Social Influence (real and virtual),"Aidan Reid Follow -- Listen Share In theprevious postwe discussed the four keys to leveraging digital maps to build a community. For this post, we will share how you can form and begin to grow your own committed and engaging group. First things first, there should be a strong underlying reason why a community would form. It must connect with hearts and minds, inspiring and impassioning others to join. It must connect with hearts and minds, inspiring and impassioning others to join. It could be to share in a love ofsustainable living, tackling the global problem ofplastic waste,fascinating wreck sitesfor intrepid explorers, or even something as simple as finding the bestswimming spots. Many of the most successful communities we’ve spoken with in recent months share common themes. Social Influence (real and virtual) Communities are inherently social, often making a bridge between the digital and real world. For example,Kokozaengage their members annually through workshops which strengthen community bonds both locally and nationally. Similarly, regular group calls, forums,meetingsand conferences (TEDx,ImpactHub) can foster a sense of community becoming a breeding ground for networking opportunities. It is a bigger investment for members to take the time to meet in person but the rewards for doing so can be adeeper connection with the mission and a stronger sense of community. Ambition Every community goal starts with a ‘why’. How to get there is the challenging part and requires dedicated effort from the community leader and involves cycled feedback. WC Kompasis a community searching for solutions for patients with IBD. They share with their members the important steps being taken to spread awareness of the disease. Through their crowdsourcing map they inform and educate members about the medical breakthroughs and partnerships to promote their cause. Your community doesn’t need to change the world, but by having clearly defined goals you and your group can tweak your approach accordingly. Responsibility Without structure, a group is unlikely to thrive especially as the community numbers grow or the mission objective changes. Leaders of the mission are either appointed or in many cases are the source of inspiration for the group. They could beambassadors(recruited for PR), community architects (streamlining UX) or simply someone who has a deeply held passion for the cause. ‘Hands-on’ or ‘hands-off’, there should be at least be someone that the group can revert to to ensure their voice is heard and acted upon. Energy and Drive Successful communities take time to develop — often years. With the advent of social media, it’s never been easier to create a group/page around a theme. But with ease comes attrition, and Facebook and other channels have become a graveyard for many digital communities. The projects which perform best are those with a long term-vision, embracing the community (online and offline) and driven by passionate individuals. For example, German artist Gunter Demnig created theStolpersteine Projectin 2008 — a timeless and valuable contribution to memorialise the Czech victims of the Nazi atrocities. However,passioncan only take you so far. It needs to be combined with the right tools, skills and mindset if you want to achieve something that lasts. Every leader needs a tribe. And even tribes need some structure. There are many places you can find community members. Facebook, Quora, Pinterest, Reddit, Instagram are just a few. Typically your passion will have associated hashtags which make it easier to find like-minded people on social channels (e.g.#bookstagrammers,#stampcollecting,#birdwatching,etc.). If you have defined your community group and members, one way to engage them is by creating a Facebook group where they are more likely to receive post notifications. The danger is that updates can be quickly buried in the newsfeed, especially for some of the bigger groups. In terms of structure, theMapoticplatform can be used to form and grow a community. You have the ability to not only curate and highlight pertinent information related to your mission, but the news feed is designed to foster and promote open collaboration and feedback. Not all communities are alike. With deeper customisation and detailed attributes, you can create a map that connects to the group’s unique values. Eliciting feedback (free of constraints) means that community members have a voice and, more importantly, can be heard. Using third-party social channels means that interactions and traffic is driven to that particular corporation. Putting aside behavioural influences and data sensitivities, it may be the case that hosting on your own domain/site is the preferred option. Mapotic enables this withEmbed Mappingfeatures ensuring that the member/customer journey is entirely controlled by you without outside interference.

Donizete (Donny) Minchillo Jr.,Pineapple Development, Founder. Which country did you emigrate from? Brazil Why did you or your family decide to immigrate? Ours is a pretty typical immigrant story. My family was very poor when I was growing up in Brazil and struggled to find opportunities to succeed. My parents saw the US as the land of opportunity and wanted to move in hopes of providing a better life with more possibilities for my brother and I. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US? Well, I was 16 years old at the time. I didn’t have much choice in the matter and as a teenager that’s difficult. I also didn’t speak any English upon arrival — so you can imagine the vulnerability of a teenage boy who doesn’t speak the language being thrown into the culture of an American high school. It was difficult to get around, to get things done, to study, to meet friends — pretty much everything was a challenge at first. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. Did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story.) Luckily the biggest overhead element in our business is paying our team members, and we started with one other person besides my wife and I, so we knew we wouldn’t necessarily pay ourselves a salary at first as long as we could cover expenses, and I was fortunate to have a few freelance web development clients that agreed to come on board when I shared that I was starting an agency — so at the beginning — as long as we didn’t lose them while we were trying to also bring on new clients, we’d have enough cash flow to pay our developer. Since then our team has quadrupled and monthly revenue has increased by 500%. My wife and I didn’t start paying ourselves a salary probably until about 6 months in if I remember correctly, and we were investing profits back into things like building our own website for the business which is obviously crucial as a web development company. We’ve now grown to a point where we have other expenses like our headquarter office space in St. Petersburg, FL — but since all of our employees are remote, this isn’t something we needed right away. Why do you think you have been successful? I honestly think my immigrant journey has been a huge factor in my success. Most people have no concept of how difficult it is to move to a new country where you don’t speak the language or really understand the culture, where you know no one, etc. It’s a risk, it’s a gamble, it’s a life-altering decision and people really wouldn’t do it 90% of the time if they felt like they had another choice. Then imagine on top of that for the huge percentage of immigrants that came to this country because their parents brought them here as a kid, really with no choice at all — it’s really sink or swim. You come to a place where there’s a great deal of pressure to not screw it up. In my experience, most immigrants come to the US with a lot of admiration and respect and they’re ready to do whatever it takes to hopefully make their lives better by tapping into to engrained sense of opportunity and possibility that exists here. But there’s a great deal of negativity facing immigrants as well. It’s not easy by any stretch of the imagination and it builds this sense of character, at least it did for me, where failure is simply not an option. Your parents uprooted their entire life and made huge sacrifices to bring you to the land of opportunity and you better make something of it. That’s sort of the feeling that has been a driving force for me. It started for me with learning English. I was made fun of for my accent in high school when I started to learn the language and I made it my mission to speak perfect English. And I’ve used that same approach for everything I’ve ever done including starting a business. Challenges and any kind of animosity have always driven me to want to do something full force and to be the best. What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship? My advice is to find and network with anyone who could be a possible mentor to you as much as possible. Talk to people about their stories, ask lots of questions, listen carefully to the answers and develop relationships with people in a way that you can call on them when you need advice or have a question that’s stumping you. That and focus on gaining a wide variety of experiences. For me working in a few different industries before starting my own business taught me a lot about the culture. The way people work, professional expectations, consumer expectations, communication, etc. In order to be successful, you have to really understand the business landscape around you and when you were born and raised in another country, making sure you give yourself the necessary experiences to learn the things you may not inherently know is key.",Amine Rahal,https://medium.com/@aminerahal613?source=post_page---byline--42ef4f4ae376---------------------------------------,0,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO,2019-01-04T18:54:40.226Z,Medium

La ciberseguridad volverá a ser uno de los principales focos de atención tanto para las empresas como para los usuarios particulares, habida cuenta de las crecientes amenazan que pululan por la red. El informe de PandaLabs para 2019 se atreve a aventurar cuáles serán las tendencias en ciberseguridad más importantes. Al igual que elstreamingha cambiado la forma en la que escuchamos música, sin necesidad ya de adquirir discos o de descargar previamente las pistas, la piratería también podría optar por un formato “en vivo”. Esta es una tendencia delictiva particularmente grave porque nunca se sabe cuándo y dónde se va a producir el siguiente ataque. No hay unmalwarea la espera de ser descargado imprudentemente sino que unhackerataca directamente una red. Quédate con este concepto porque es posible que no tardes mucho en escucharlo por boca de alguna de las principales autoridades de la Unión Europea. Esta organización supranacional está dotándose de mayores recursos para hacer frente al desafío de la ciberseguridad y la soberanía digital puede ser una realidad legislativa a medio plazo. Proteger el espacio digital de la UE es una prioridad desde que se constatara la injerencia de potencias extranjeras en procesos electorales de algunos países miembros. Junto a los dos novedades anteriores, algunas de las amenazas que ya afectaron a la ciberseguridad mundial en 2018 seguirán estando presentes -y con mayor intensidad- en 2019. Cryptojacking El uso indebido de computadoras para hacer trabajos de minería de criptomonedas parece un riesgo menor pero lo cierto es que se traduce en un consumo de datos muy oneroso, al tiempo que colaboramos indirectamente con un comportamiento delictivo. Robo de datos personales Las violaciones de datos personales han sido el ciberataque estrella de 2018, con una cifra récord de afectados. Cambridge Analytica, Facebook o Ticketmaster han sido algunas de las grandes víctimas del robo de información personal (y, con ellas, sus miles de millones de usuarios o clientes).

https://medium.com/@catherinenoujaim/dear-apple-fa7f5228cead?source=tag_archive---------170-----------------------,Dear Apple,Written byCatherine Noujaim,"Catherine Noujaim Follow -- Listen Share (And other tech corporations) You want to know why people aren’t buying your new phones? Well, several issues. Your stuff doesn’t work together anymore. Or if it does work together, it does so to the detriment of the customer, of the user. I bought a new desktop last year. It no longer has a disc drive of any kind. I could not upload my music to it off the ipad or iphone, which are both older. When I got the ipad and phone initially, they were newer than my computer, so I couldn’t really synch them either. However, they are apparently synched enough so if I delete pics off the ipad or phone, they get deleted on the computer. Which, ARGH. I keep hesitating to buy a new phone, even though the old one is on its last legs, and now refuses to actually ring. Why? in part, security. In part, I want my music, thank you. I also don’t WANT a huge phone. I have an ipad for that. I have small hands. I know other people who keep hoping you will come out with something smaller. Also, most people are aware we live in a finite world. We want the stuff we buy to last. We want good manufacturing practices. We don’t want kids mining the rare ores for our phones. We want the people making our phones to have protections. To not get cancer. We are tired of a new gizmo every year, and losing more privacy, more security every year with the release of the new devices. You want to increase your sales? talk to real people about what they want. We want a better world, a better environment. We want actual recycling from companies. We want fair wages for the people who dig the ores. We want usability. I want a phone that I can listen to music on, music that I bought copies of. I want to be able to take photos on my phone, and be able to synch completely with newer and older models of desktop, etc. I know, I know, its a pipe dream.

https://medium.com/shamstastic/the-10-cardinal-rules-for-a-satisfying-life-c7561070554e?source=tag_archive---------65-----------------------,The 10 Cardinal Rules for a Satisfying Life,Published inShabbir Shams,"Shabbir Shams Follow Shabbir Shams -- Listen Share I’ve mused over this headline for a while. And I’ve thought about this story for the last 5 years. I make mental notes on my Pixel, my iPad, in Google Keep, on a notepad, and discuss-it-to-death sessions with my patient wife, Rashida Shams. And I think I have nailed it. Here is a distillation of the collective wisdom from countless books I’ve read, meetings with hundreds of newsmakers, eccentrics, philosophers, and mysticals over hedonic lunches, coffees, dinners andqawahsessions — and working with some of the most talented, inspirational people in three (3) Fortune 500 companies and five (5) startups. Note: This is not an exhaustive list.There might be 11 rules. #1 — Embrace your passion.Countless pundits have said this. Numerous movies made, speeches given, words spoken. There is a reason. There is no passion to be found in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. Live by choice, not by chance. Whatever your passion, just do it. The world will reciprocate. Money will follow. Dreams will become realities. Take the first step — today. #2 — Take care of yourself, first.Eat, drink, think, sleep, and live better. Research repeatedly proves this. A healthy body + a healthy mind = amazing experiences. Stretch in the morning. Eat a garlic clove everyday. Drink water. Munch less. Eat nutrient-dense foods, not calorie-dense. Last meal at the 3-hour mark before sleep. Brush your teeth. Comb your hair. Wash your face. Looking good, confidence, calm mind, bright skin, and a positive outlook are wired together. Make peace with your past. You don’t need to be better than anyone else; you just need to be better than you used to be. #3 — Build a strong network.A strong network means a network you can learn from, teach, and be inspired from. A strong network can be relaxing (friends get-together on a Thursday over drinks) and it also means people you can rely on for professional help and guidance. Avoid backbiters, pessimists, manipulators, energy-drainers — as well as folks who are wavering, unreliable, disloyal, and untrustworthy. They are best met with a hand wave from far away. Be the dumbest person in the room — learn from others. Remember: you are the average of the 5 people you connect with the most. Choose your network wisely. #4 — Read books.If someone can give you a lifetime of learnings in a book for $20 or so, jump on it. You are learning and stretching your mind. You are getting tips to advance rapidly vs learning and stumbling on your own. Read different genres. Absorb the old and new texts. Read history, religion, politics, arts, business and more. Avoid gimmicky and instant-gratification books. The 48 Laws of Power, Animal Farm, Rework, and countless others are permanently on my bookshelf. You will become a better story-teller, and a better citizen when you understand all perspectives. If you don’t dig books, look to YouTube, Udemy, Khan Academy, TED Talks, and more. #5 — Capture and savour moments.Instant coffee. Uber. Subway hops. Eat-and-go. Drive-thrus. There’s rarely time to stop — and smell the roses, tree leaves, and the rain. Look around. Slo-mo your walk. Inhale. Exhale. Smell. Feel. Touch. The world is a fascinating place — be it your neighborhood street or basking on an exotic beach. My favorite hobby is taking photos. Endless streams. Not superficial, narcissistic selfies (well, maybe sometimes) — but of people, contexts, and places that will be fun to scroll on my phone/tablet or see in photobooks (that my wife makes). It will put a genuine smile on your face. #6 — Take care of others.Something magical happens when you help someone. You get rewarded by karma. Countless billionaires do this — and swear by it. In fact, almost all the folks on the Forbes list confirm that giving is something they started a long time ago before they became wealthy — and wish they could have started much earlier in life. Giving is powerful. For both parties. Help someone financially. Assist someone with polishing their resume. Mow your aunt’s lawn. Pay for the next person in the fast-food checkout lane. Give flowers to your wife. Giving is not measured in dollars and size, but in intention and heart. #7 — Travel the earth.We live on an amazing planet. Bountiful, full of life, surprises, wonders, majestic cities, and breath-taking horizons. If you have never ventured outside your city/state/country, you are missing out. Spend money on experiences, not things. Try the strange-sounding (or looking) dish. Learn a few words in a foreign language. Venture in a never-set-foot neighborhood in your city. We travel, initially, to lose ourselves — and we travel, next, to find ourselves. #8 — Consume wisely.We are bombarded with subtle messages. Buy this. Drink that. Wear those. Billboards, Instagram ads, TV, and YouTube — it’s everywhere. Make cleaner, better, wiser choices. Learn about who is making what you are consuming. Understand the value-system, political stances, and ethical/social alignments of companies. Understand what is it that you are consuming. Carbon footprints, quality, purity, and ulterior motive. Cheaper is almost always more expensive for your body, soul, the earth or society. Eat less, exercise more. Skip upgrading your phone every year, and invest in your education, someone else’s, or pay off debt. Demand better quality — be it food or your iPhone charger. Bring your own cup for coffee. Recycle newspapers — better yet, read digital. #9 — Earn more.Money is important. It warms our homes, and makes the world go round. Enough of it cushions the harsh realities of the world. It allows you to travel, explore, sing, laugh, eat, and be yourself — comfortably. It insulates you. Focusing on it too much is when it becomes a disease. Having it allows you to expeditiously help people around you. Be part of causes that move you, inspire you. Earn it smartly. If you’re in a dead-end job, quit (see rule #1). Have diverse and multiple lines of income. Replace every expense with an automatic income stream ($100 monthly cell phone bill paid by online advertising revenue from your blog/Instagram/YouTube). Go from employee, to self-employed, to business owner, to investor. Employees exchange time for money. Business owners leverage (10 Uber-like drivers working for a taxi business owner). Start early. Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. #10 — Be spiritual.Find your purpose, and your place. Believe in something greater than you. Anchor yourself with submission to powers beyond your realm. An unexamined life is not worth living. Repair your wounds, face your demons, conquer yourself. Embrace karma, listen to soulful music, gaze into the endless lake/ocean, and cherish serendipity. Let go of trying to control everything, and trying to please everyone. Let go of a sense of entitlement, pride, perfectionism, and negativity. And learn to seek comfort in resentment and failure. When you judge others, you do not define them, you define yourself. Free yourself. The cosmic world will adjust/plan/work to make you achieve the impossible. That, will be your legacy.

From facilitating the customers to promoting business, a customized enterprise mobile app can perform a wide range of operations. The app can thereby promote the growth of the company by increasing the sales figure. As Techopedia mentions, An Enterprise Application or EA is a specially designed software system that operates in a corporate environment. The corporate can be anything like a local or state Government body, a business of any size, non-profit groups, etc. Theenterprise application development companycan make a customized app with characteristics like scalability, robustness, business-orientation, communication and managerial abilities. All these aspects give enterprise apps an edge over normal apps. Let’s dig deep into the enterprise app development process to explore what it can do and the hurdles are there in the way of making an app that can address the requirements of employees and customers alike. We will go through the process from the perspective of the user’s expectations. How do we want the Enterprise app development process to be? Well, a reliable mobile application development company can take up the projects of developing enterprise software. The reason is simple: Only such a company has necessary expertise and experience to build customized enterprise software. Both these aspects are necessary because the enterprise mobile app development involves a complex process that includes the following features. Focus on users— Just like traditional apps, the enterprise app also focuses on the end users. The user-centric enterprise app should give a pleasant experience, and capable of adding more and more users. In a way, the enterprise app should act as a bridge between clients and the employees. Only such an app can ultimately meet its goals. Security— It is obvious that an enterprise app deals in loads of data on a daily basis. The data can be segregated in the customer’s data and corporate data. In both types, the data safety plays a critical role. The security aspect is also necessary for the app that facilitates online transactions. As the incidences of security breaches are increasing worldwide, it is necessary to have An app with the highest level of security. Integration— Enterprises use various devices and software for simplifying and automating their processes. An enterprise mobile app can be seamlessly integrated with all these devices. Also, it should be an integral part of the existing business system while connecting with the existing resources. Speed— 5G technology is all set to come in our lives. It will bring the days of high speed of network and apps. There, an enterprise app should be compatible with the current and upcoming technology trends. Also, the ever-increasing pile of data should also be taken care of by mobile app developers. Well, these are a few of expectations from a feature-rich enterprise app. It is interesting to see how it works in reality, at least to date.

https://medium.com/@xcelcorp/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-5b6edab1a6e2?source=tag_archive---------171-----------------------,Blockchain — The Invisible Technology,Written byXCEL Corp,"XCEL Corp Follow -- Listen Share Researchers and technologists alike are excited about the rise of blockchain technology, which is foretold to be the next colossal innovation that will help companies garner wealth and resources. This, clearly, seems to have caught everyone’s fancy. So, what exactly is it? An append-only ledger, in a blockchain, users can add new information, without editing, erasing or adjusting any previous information. That is why the data is stored in the form of blocks using cryptography that links contents from the newly added block into the one that is already existing before it. The technology is designed in a manner that any change to the contents of a previous block in the chain would invalidate the data in all the blocks after it. Purely driven by consensus, it works on the principle of network and connectivity of a large number of computers thus reducing malicious transactional invasions by an attacker. There are orchestrations and applications of older principal technologies that are combined to create a blockchain. They are the private key cryptography, a ledger and an incentive to service the transaction such as security and record-keeping. Purposefully, possession of a combination of public and private cryptographic keys create a secure digital identity and reference. The amalgamation is seen as a dexterous form of consent and also regarded as a digital signature, which, in turn, provides control of ownership. Since the technology accommodates a large network of validators, this remains one of the blockchain’s most attractive attributes since it amasses large computing power. At the same time, if we’re to distill the usage of the blockchain, the primary benefit of the underlying technology is to address the problem of double-spending. Predominantly used in the creation and maintenance of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is susceptible to counter issues where there is a risk of a holder sending copies of the same bitcoin into different transactions advancing the notorious double-spending. A block is created with the details about the transaction and is broadcasted to all the nodes each time a new transaction takes place. A reference to the previous block in the chain is carried by every new block with a timestamp, thus establishing a sequence of events. The new block gets linked to the previous block when the authenticity of the transaction is proven. When such a chain of blocks is replicated across the network, all of them are cryptographically secured which makes hacking virtually impossible. Not just to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, blockchain technology can be applied to any asset that requires storage, distribution, and transaction such as music, property titles, data, insurance and much more. Here are some ways in which blockchain can be applied to businesses Accounting textbooks to handle the challenges of complex tax codes Advertising and marketing to dramatically reduce click frauds In human resources to plan, direct and coordinate recruiting Cybersecurity to disseminate names, addresses, dates of birth and other associated information And these are only a few… Here are some ways in which blockchain can be applied to businesses• Accounting textbooks to handle the challenges of complex tax codes• Advertising and marketing to dramatically reduce click frauds• In human resources to plan, direct and coordinate recruiting• Cybersecurity to disseminate names, addresses, dates of birth and other associated information And these are only a few… Revolutionizing TechnologyWhile the technology seems to have taken the digital world by storm, it does come with some practical limitations. Institutions where malleability is required or where there is no added advantage of decentralization, the technology clearly cannot be applied. For example, medical records might be complicated with the use of blockchain. Federal regulations do not permit healthcare institutions to publicize medical records. It is only by encrypting information and storing these encryption keys in centralized entities that the technology can be made to work. Additionally, the licensing of this information has to be controlled by a central authority to make sure that records are not hijacked. Changing erroneous information injected into the chain may also be rather impossible. There was no way to secure and validate ownership in a digital asset or verify a transaction in a trustless, public manner prior to the advent of the blockchain. This is the first technology that transfers digital ownership in a decentralized way. Although it might seem that the platforms supporting the blockchain ecosystem are yet to evolve, there certain businesses that will still benefit from its use. Businesses that are transaction-based, the ones that have a history that cannot be manipulated, those that benefit from public scrutiny and finally, a business where such decentralization actually benefits the customer or the end user. ConclusionIt is forecast that the supporting technology around blockchain is all set to evolve and quickly. One of the biggest benefits derived from it would be consumer awareness and the evolution of an equally supportive community. Businesses can truly benefit by incorporating this technology into their services and products and by tapping into the growing community of engineers. Blockchain technology has caught everyone’s fancy because it is believed to fundamentally change how we exchange value. It is most certainly a technology that holds a vast promise, which is yet in its nascent stages and is something to look forward to in the future.",XCEL Corp,https://medium.com/@xcelcorp?source=post_page---byline--5b6edab1a6e2---------------------------------------,1,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png,2019-03-18T13:29:26.526Z,Medium

The latest version of TOGAF 9.2 is the result of collective work of many years by several contributors. TOGAF has been adopted by more than 80% of the world’s leading enterprises and now a global standard for EA. TOGAF provides a realistic view of enterprise architecture highlighting the central role of an organisation. It is placed as a generic method, which groups together a set of tools and techniques for EA. Any Enterprise Architecture effort requires a good collaboration — Governance, stakeholders, architecture and implementation teams are among the many subjects handled well by TOGAF. Business goals— Architecture is based on an enterprise’s business goals and they act as the main driving force for business change. The Human Factor / The People— Enterprise architecture is by the people and for the people in the organisation. The quality of the results is directly proportional to the commitment of people involved. Communication— One of the main aims of EA is the enablement of communication among all stakeholders. This means that architecture and communication process must be mastered at all decision-making levels. Governance— Efficient governance which drives change and at the same time maintains overall architectural consistency. TOGAF supports four commonly accepted subsets of EA - Business Architecture — Defines the business strategy, governance, organisation and key business processes. Data Architecture — Describes the structure of organisation’s logical and physical data and data management resources. It is management of information in the organisation. Application Architecture — Provides a blueprint of all applications to be deployed, its interactions and relationships with the core business processes in the organisation Technology Architecture- Describes software and hardware capabilities needed to deploy business systems, data and application services.Includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications and standards etc. TOGAF consists of the following tools – Architectural Development Method (ADM) Enterprise Continuum Architecture Repository Finally, The success of any enterprise architecture lies in the clarity of the results and goals enterprise hope to achieve. TOGAF framework stresses on following few with laser sharp focus for success - Strategic goals which directs the change. Operational objectives to validate and measure results of the goals at a given time. Business drivers that motivate the transformation and architectural decisions. The WHY that justify GOALS.

https://medium.com/@theclassytim/the-realities-of-an-engineering-degree-d1d0851d69ed?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,The Realities of an Engineering Degree,Written byTim Chinenov,"Tim Chinenov Follow -- 1 Listen Share This last December I completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering, an accomplishment of a four and a half year endeavor. The journey through this degree was not what I or many of my peers had expected it to be. Truthfully, I thought being an engineer would involve me tinkering with electronics, motors, and gizmos endlessly. Instead, the following four and a half years were filled with constant learning of material my immature brain was not quite prepared for. While I believe my institution does a good job at transitioning students from high school to college, the majority of freshmen simply cannot fathom the effort and discipline required to succeed in a STEM degree. Four years of painstaking persistent dedication. This is not to say I have not enjoyed my academic experience in engineering. On the contrary, I’m disappointed now that I will not have access to the brilliant teachers and minds at my school. Yet, I think it is dangerous to enter a field with false notions of what is entailed. For one, this can result in a considerable loss of time and money. For novice engineers or those considering pursuing the field, I hope to dispel incorrect beliefs or stereotypes of an engineering degree. Classes Focus on Theory and Fundamentals For the first solid year, possibly two, engineers learn the absolute basic mathematical backgrounds required for the majority of their field. Classes perform a broad exploration of various math topics. Content can often feel random, and it’s application not immediately clear. In Calculus I, topics covered include linearization, Taylor series, and various trigonometric integration techniques. I cannot remember when I last used any of the above methods or topics. Yet, this does not suggest such topics are pointless. Impractical or arcane matter can often discourage students. Few freshman poses a mindset to learn for the sake of learning. Many early college students view school as an obstacle guarding free time. A practical use is often demanded. Yet, that is not necessarily the purpose of these prerequisite and introductory classes. Such classes cannot predict which facet of mathematics you will use the most in your future career. Tyro electrical engineers learn how to derive Laplace and Fourier transforms. Mathematics in Biomedical Engineering can rely more heavily on statistics. Computer scientists focus entirely on logical proofs and discreet mathematics for their first two years. These prerequisite courses attempt to dissolve uncertainty by covering a slew of content. The classes that are taken towards the end of a graduate degree, tend to be more pertinent to the work that one might find in the real world. Yet, even these advanced courses still focus on ingraining fundamental concepts. Classes familiarize students with the underlying math. Many of these concepts have already been black boxed into tools for engineers in the work force. Once you enter industry, programs such as Matlab or python libraries become a common substitute for hand worked solutions. An understanding of how a block box works is still valuable. Who knows, your black box may fail one day. These advanced classes, again, attempt to prepare a fresh graduate for an array of complex problems. Just the way prerequisite math classes cannot predict the mathematics a undergraduate student will use late in their curriculum, advanced classes cannot predict what challenges and applications one will be faced within the work force. Applied Experience Comes From Yourself I don’t believe I touched a circuit board until my third semester of college (although I did write code). This applies to most engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers may learn the dynamic equations behind a prototypical mass-spring-damper system, but the students will hardly ever implement and observe such a theoretical system. Chemical engineers will have entire classes dedicated to designing theoretical plant systems, but, mostly for financial reasons, will never go out and build said plant. Since the majority of class work is theoretical, the most applied experience an engineering student can get is outside of a classroom. To this reason, I find students gain much industry preparation from their activities outside of class. Hands on clubs — Rocket club, Engineers without borders, Undergraduate Research, and Electronics club — give students an opportunity to use their knowledge on application. Chalk board math is given a purpose through such club projects. STEM activities tend to expose students to using relevant software, tools, and hardware that are likely to be found in the field. One of my college acquaintances graduated and directly went to work for SpaceX. They previously interned at Tesla and JPL before hand. The student attributed their success in obtaining these positions largely to their involvement in our schools Formula One club. Having external experiences can make students standout to recruiters more than a high GPA. While a high GPA does demonstrate a strong level of discipline and ability to learn quickly, it does not suggest that an applicant is practical. Companies are pragmatic. While a business can wait two to three weeks to catch you up to speed, in a ten to twelve week internship, this is not preferable. Having previous hands-on experience is not only useful, but lucrative as well. This does not mean that class work and content is frivolous. From my comments on the theoretical nature of classes and the benefits of extracurricular activities, it may be easy to think this. Class work is undoubtedly important, as it develops the fundamentals necessary to make the most of ones projects. The difference between a tinkerer and an engineer is that a tinkerer plays with components until something works, while an engineer understands why components work and can apply mathematical principles to make them work better. There is a lot of Math This thought may appear trivial. Yet, I find that incoming students grossly underestimate just how much math there is in an engineering degree. Before entering college, few have an idea of what it means to only do math. We wake up and do math for the next ten or more hours. After brushing my teeth, I go work on differential equations. Before lunch I try to wrap up some statistical analysis code. While I wait for a friend in a cafe I parse my linear algebra notes. The fun doesn’t cease. Depending on the sect of engineering, the math can get pretty imaginative. Engineering is not going to be four years of applied Pythagoras theorem or even basic derivatives. Many given problems also have a distinct answer. Unlike a rudimentary high school English paper, students cannot fiddle their way to a result. Professors occasionally give partial credit, but one cannot rely on merely partial credit to get by. Few freshman poses a mindset to learn for the sake of learning. Many early college students view school as an obstacle guarding free time. Few freshman poses a mindset to learn for the sake of learning. Many early college students view school as an obstacle guarding free time. I find those that truly become successful engineering students, are those that get engrossed and enthralled in the math. These are students that truly enjoy the subject matter and see their degree as more than a means to an end. There is a great level of satisfaction that is obtained from understanding difficult concepts and to be able to prove or apply them. I believe the understanding of the mathematical rigor of an engineering degree is crucial. Many students get quickly burdened by the intensity of college. Unless you are an adept planner or came with numerous number of credits, many semesters will have the constant pressure reminiscent of a marathon. There will be a continuous reminders that work needs to be done. Becoming lackadaisical with study habits or home works is a quick road to falling behind. A simple out of state interview or conference trip alone can easily take a toll on one’s ability to commit to deadlines or retain a proper sleep schedule. Only once you complete your last final exam of the semester, does it feel like you can breath again. This discussion can come of as intimidating, and I mean it to be. A STEM degree is not a joke. But, I don’t mean to dissuade people from the field. There are many degrees and realms of engineering that use arguably simpler mathematics. Furthermore, some areas of engineering are not made for everyone. I for one, am terrible at chemistry and have dreaded every related course. I’ve met engineering students that do not necessarily want to be career engineers. Some go for an MBA or law school after their bachelors of science. I even know a chemical engineer whose first job upon graduation was for a financial firm as an accountant. So, one’s success in understanding niche and complicated maths is not a necessity for success in the field. Yet, if one falls into the above categories, they must have realistic expectations of what their undergraduate experience will be like and hold themselves to achievable and realistic standards. The Field is Evolving Over the four and a half years I spent obtaining my degree, I watched the engineering and technology field rapidly change. The industry right now is growing at an alarming rate, and it’s exciting. The main skills searched for during my first career fair differed from those in my last career fair. This can also be seen when working in industry. Companies are placing a bigger emphasis on simulation modeling, cyber security, and statistical modeling. How does this change affect the degree? Personally, I found it to be considerably difficult to stick to a single specialization. Towards the end of their college degree, students customarily develop a concentration. A electrical engineer may specialize in power, a civil engineer may specialize in road systems, etc. With such a slew of new fields entering the computer engineering realm, such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, embedded controls, and control systems, it is easy to become inundated by your curiosity. Some companies are enthusiastic in hiring people with diverse backgrounds. But, more often than not, companies like to see specialization. Additionally, there is an apparent lag between industry and university. Many universities will not provide the most modern and relevant courses to students. The department I belonged to gained a machine learning course during my last semester, which felt rather underdeveloped. I’m aware that for many colleges it’s incredibly rare to have advanced topics, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, as available as classes. Due to this delay with industry, it lies on the initiative and independence on the individual student to gain experience on these fields. A suitable substitute for absent classes can be found in undergraduate research and self-learning. In my first lecture at university, which was ironically a psychology class, the professor spoke the common sentiment, “The point of college is not to get a degree or to become a good engineer, but to learn how to learn.” A proper engineering degree will teach a student to be able to work independently, intelligently skeptical, and have a strong work ethic. But none of this is obtained easily. This piece isn’t meant to deter people from the degree. In fact, more people should become part of this progressive and vital industry. However, coming in with a correct understanding of what the degree entails will better prepare you for the struggles and hurdles associated with it. Every student is surprised by some aspect of this degree. Being prepared to respond appropriately can greatly benefit.",Tim Chinenov,,34,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg,2019-01-03T17:34:59.478Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@rutuja.wanjari2/oauth-chapter-1-understanding-oauth-5f6391f0d79f?source=tag_archive---------172-----------------------,OAuth — Chapter 1-Understanding OAuth,Written byRutuja Wanjari,"Rutuja Wanjari Follow -- Listen Share OAuth 2.0is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials. OAuth 2.0is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials. To get access to the protected resources OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens. An Access Token is a string representing the granted permissions. Access Token Format By default, Auth0 generates Access Tokens, forAPI Authorization scenarios, inJSON Web Token (JWT)format. JWTs contain three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature: The header contains metadata about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithms used to secure its contents. The payload contains a set of claims, which are statements about the permissions that should be allowed, and other information like the intended audience and the expiration time. The signature is used to validate that the token is trustworthy and has not been tampered with. In any OAuth 2.0 flow we can identify the following roles: Resource Owner: the entity that can grant access to a protected resource. Typically this is the end-user. Resource Server: the server hosting the protected resources. This is the API you want to access. Client: the app requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the Resource Owner. Authorization Server: the server that authenticates the Resource Owner, and issues Access Tokens after getting proper authorization. In this case, Auth0. The Application (Client) asks for authorization from the Resource Owner in order to access the resources. Provided that the Resource Owner authorizes this access, the Application receives an Authorization Grant. This is a credential representing the Resource Owner’s authorization. The Application requests an Access Token by authenticating with the Authorization Server and giving the Authorization Grant. Provided that the Application is successfully authenticated and the Authorization Grant is valid, the Authorization Server issues an Access Token and sends it to the Application. The Application requests access to the protected resource by the Resource Server, and authenticates by presenting the Access Token. Provided that the Access Token is valid, the Resource Server serves the Application’s request. We want to login into some application say XYZ.This login can be done via third party like Google or Facebook or Twitter. Let’s consider we use gmail. Here OAuth works as, instead of filling the registration details by applicant, gmail can authenticate and fill the details for us. Here the following four entities are involved: New Customer i.e.Resource Owner Google is theResource Serverwhere customer credentials reside XYZ is theOAuth Client, they need information Gmail is theAuthorization Serveri.e OAuth Provider All big companies like Facebook, Google, Github,… use this kind of authorization. Like above example you can sign in on medium using your Google account, this means “medium” doesn’t know my password, it receives the allowance from Google where my password (hashed obviously) is saved. This gives a lot of benefits, one of them is; In the near future you won’t have to make several accounts on every website. One website (which you trust most) can be used to login to all other websites. So you’ll only have to remember one password. If we want to fill an application form for a bank account. Here OAuth works as, instead of filling the form by applicant, bank can fill the form using some ID proof or address proof like passport. Here the following four entities are involved: Applicant i.e.Resource Owner Any database server where passport credentials reside —Resource Server Bank Account isOAuth Client, they need information Passport ID isAuthorization Serveri.e OAuth Provider I hope you must have got an idea on what purpose OAuth serves. In the next chapter we will dive into using OAuth in a Flask application.

This never changes while roaming , if IMSI is not changing, the HPLMN will not change. VPLMN: Visited PLMN. The PLMN id is the for roaming network. EPLMN : Equivalent PLMN. If a subscriber roames in Home PLMN there is no roaming. Subscriber always see the signals of the home mobile network operator. An operator may not have much coverage , so they do collaborations with othermobileoperators , where the roaming will not be applied. This is call EPLMN. Subscriber have impression that he is in his home network. E.g TheIDEA networkin India might not have coverage in some state. There it can use another mobile operator (e.g Airtel).

Sorry, Siri, but I find you and Alexa creepy. I worry that native intelligence is being replaced by “artificial intelligence,” which strikes me as a modern-day oxymoron, like “virtual reality.” I’m scared about what’s coming as technology takes over our lives. And I’m nearly convinced robots are going to make humans unnecessary if not extinct. Call me crazy, but that’s what they called Jules Verne too. It seems I’m in good company. Some pretty big names in science and technology have also expressed concern about the inherent risks AI could pose. They include the late physicist Stephen Hawking who told the BBC several years ago that, “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Elon Musk, engineer and head of Tesla, has said that autonomous machines could unleash “weapons of terror,” comparing the adoption of AI to “summoning the devil.” And Bill Gates is worried that AI is only viable if we make sure humans remain in control of machines. As one techie posted on Tech Times.com, what happens if Siri decides that she wants to take over the world? He didn’t seem to think that was a real threat, but what if AI becomes so advanced that it decides it wants power of its own? Others worry that if artificially intelligent systems misunderstand a mission they’re given, they could cause more damage than good and end up hurting lots of people. A lot of folks are worried about the implications of AI-controlled weapons. They might be able to help soldiers and civilians in war zones, but they could also cause a global arms race that could end up being disastrous. According to a scientist at the Future of Life Institute, “There is an appreciable probability that the course of human history over the next century will be dramatically affected by how AI is developed. It would be extremely unwise to leave this to chance,” he argues. There are also troubling ways in which AI could infringe upon our personal privacy. Facebook’s recent problems have already demonstrated some of the possibilities, from unwanted intrusion to exposure that leaves us vulnerable. Facebook can already recognize someone by the clothes they wear, the books they read, and the movies they watch. What happens when government agencies have fully developed recognition systems? In one alarming thesis put forward by Nick Bostrom, an Oxford University philosopher, artificial intelligence may prove to be apocalyptic. He thinks AI “could effortlessly enslave or destroy Homo sapiens if they so wished.” No longer the stuff of science fiction, many AI milestones have already been reached even thought experts thought it would take decades to get where we are now in terms of relevant technology. While some scientists think it will take a long time to develop human-level AI or superintelligence, others at a 2015 conference thought it would happen within the next forty years or so. Given AI’s potential to exceed human intelligence, we really don’t know how it will behave. If humans are no longer the smartest beings on earth, how do we get to stay in control? A recent, lengthy article about “Superior Intelligence” inThe New Yorker, pointed out that imbuing AI with higher intelligence than humans have risks having robots turn against us. “Intelligence and power seek their own increase,” Tad Friendly posited in his piece. “Once an AI surpasses us, there’s no reason to believe it will feel grateful to us for inventing it, particularly if we haven’t figured out how to imbue it with empathy.” Here’s another interesting thing to contemplate. In 1988, Friendly shares, “roboticist Hans Moravec observed that tasks we find difficult are child’s play for a computer, and vice versa. ‘It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.’” And here’s a scary thought: According toThe New Yorker, Vladimir Putin told Russian schoolchildren not long ago that “the future belongs to artificial intelligence. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” In light of recent interference with western elections, one must wonder what he’s got in the way of AI technology (or whether he has already found a way to infiltrate Donald Trump’s brain and program his mouth.) I realize I may be getting ahead of things and sounding unduly alarmist, but it’s all pretty scary stuff. I hope the day never comes when people younger than I am have to admit that, along with Stephen Hawking et. al., I was not totally out in left field. Worse still, I hope they never have to dodge incoming missiles directed by maniacal robots angry because we didn’t make them even smarter and more powerful than they already are. # # # Elayne writes and worries from Saxtons River, Vt.www.elayne-clift.com",Elayne Clift,https://medium.com/@eclift?source=post_page---byline--772612f1bbec---------------------------------------,50,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg,2019-01-03T21:32:50.302Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@buytiny/the-dos-and-donts-of-buying-the-fusion3-f410-3d-printer-review-2a0cbcb5ebb4?source=tag_archive---------102-----------------------,The Dos And Don’ts Of Buying The Fusion3 F410 3d Printer (Review),Written byBuytiny,"Buytiny Follow -- Listen Share The Fusion3 F410 3D Printer has been intended to furnish clients with execution and sturdiness equaling modern printers at a small amount of the expense. Fusion3 F410 is an excellent pick for a small machine that packs the punch of a much larger and more expensive 3D printer. At $4,599, the F410 it’s a great deal that goes beyond the usual entry-level fare to quickly create amazing designs. High quality parts at blazingly quick speeds (up to 250MM/sec) — All metal 3D print head with solidified steel spout. The Fusion3 410 is worth every penny. This product is encased in a print zone with multi-zone warmed bed, giving stable temperatures to high temperature materials and wellbeing from hot surfaces (14″x14″x12.4″) — Optional HEPA and Carbon channel for inadequately ventilated work zones — Pre-amassed and aligned at Fusion3’s manufacturing plant for ideal execution — Modular segments and helpful access to the inside for simple upkeep and adjusting — 4.7″ Color contact screen — Automated bed leveling - A 2 year limited warranty is offered on this printer for any minor damages or replacements that might need to be fixed. Simplify3D Creator works with Windows, Mac, Linux Base Warranty: 24 mo materials and workmanship. For more data, visithttp://www.fusion3design.com Highlights In light of combined statement displaying (FDM) innovation, the F410 includes a contort: three tradable printheads with various sizes of expulsion tips. The one you should utilize relies upon the speed and precision of the ideal thing. The F410 incorporates the 0.4mm tip that can set down 20-to 300-micron layers with a resilience of 75 microns. In the event that you require more exactness, you’d utilize the 0.6mm tip that can make 100-to 400-micron layers with a precision of 115 microns. At long last, the 0.8mm tip makes 200-and 500-micron layers with a resilience of around 150 microns. With the diverse printheads, the goals can fit the venture. They cost $160 and can be swapped in around five minutes by relaxing two screws. Of the three, the 0.8mm printhead is the speed evil spirit, with the capacity to set down material as quick as 250 mm for each second — twofold the speed of numerous FDM printers and 66% quicker than theMakerBot Replicator Z18. Indeed, even the 0.4mm printhead produces 110 mm of material for every second. As opposed to moving its own fiber, Fusion3 adopts an open-source strategy that confirms crude materials from outsider merchants. With accomplices like Atomic Filament and 3DXTech, it offers a more extensive assortment of potential outcomes than any single organization can achieve. The accessible materials incorporate nylon, polylactic corrosive, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyethylene terephthalate and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate. There are claim to fame fibers like carbon fiber, fiberglass, polycarbonate, and an adaptable plastic for tubing and electrical conductors. While every one of the materials are suitable for quick prototyping, the nylon fiber is best to make utilitarian parts, and the polycarbonate material can withstand higher temperatures. These crude materials are commonly accessible in high contrast, yet a few, similar to the PLA fiber, have yellow, orange, dim and shocking shine in obscurity items. The fiber goes ahead open spools that are anything but difficult to load and cost as meager as $30 a reel. On the drawback, not at all like with the Leapfrog Xeed 3D, the F410’s single-extruder configuration implies you print the thing’s backings in the meantime out of a similar material. Coming up short on the Xeed 3D’s programmed fiber encouraging component, the F410’s fiber is stacked by bending the printer’s feed handle until the point when it gets and is maneuvered into the extruder. Another drawback is that the waste fiber can’t be reused. The printer can make swooping bends, sharp edges and straight edges for an assortment of items. Its yield is utilized in auto sequential construction system installations, model item cases and accuracy impeller sharp edges. Like the Xeed 3D, the F410 has a warmed glass organize for expanding construct consistency, however it comes up short on the Xeed’s rock choice. Prior to printing anything, you’ll have to cover the phase with paste stick to advance bond; a stick accompanies the printer. With a 14 x 14 x 12.4-inch assemble chamber, the F410 is misleadingly substantial. It can suit single things up to almost 40 liters. That is great, however second best to the MakerBot Z18’s 18-inch-tall form chamber, which can make things 4 inches longer than the F410 can. One of the littlest and lightest printers in its class, the F410 is 28.5 x 30.5 x 25.5 inches and weighs 85 pounds. It tends to be set up on a rack or tabletop. Fusion3 moves a $650 coordinating wheeled stand that has an extensive compartment for fiber and devices. Rather than the normal level entryway, the F410’s pivoted top opens vertically like a vehicle’s hood, uncovering the fabricate chamber, printhead and fiber spool. All the move makes put on the framework’s 4.7-inch shading touchscreen. It not just shows if the warmers are turned on and the temperature of the extruder and warmed stage, however it is shading coded, with green demonstrating that every ha hit its ideal temperature. On the presentation, you can begin a print work or perform upkeep, such as leveling the stage or running demonstrative checks. Like the Xeed 3D, the F410 utilizes Simplify3D programming. It works with Windows frameworks (Vista to Windows 10), Macs (10.7 or more up to date) and an assortment of Linux appropriations, for example, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora. On the drawback, there are no telephone or tablet applications that can free the administrator from a work area or journal PC. The program imports standard STL, 3MF or OBJ CAD records, which the product amends for configuration blames, upgrades and cuts into assembling areas. Before any plastic is expelled, the application includes underpins as required and demonstrates a see. Experienced fashioners can fluctuate printing parameters and even diminish how much help material is required, diminishing form times and cutting material expenses. In contrast to the Xeed 3D, the F410 manages without a webcam for remote review of the fabricate’s advancement. It interfaces by means of an Ethernet port, yet it needs Wi-Fi or the capacity to connect the F410 to a workstation with a USB link. While a large portion of its companions let you put a document onto a USB streak drive for fast in and out prints, with the F410, you’ll need to utilize a SD card. Upkeep is insignificant and incorporates clearing out flotsam and jetsam from the past forms and occasionally cleaning the extruder, fixing the printhead, and modifying the F410’s orientation and pressure links. You’ll likewise need to once in a while grease up the Z-hub bars and lead screws. The F410 accompanies a two-year guarantee, the best in the business and multiple times the inclusion that MakerBot gives. The organization doesn’t move service contracts yet incorporates lifetime support and moves new parts at expense. Fusion3’s help site incorporates an exhaustive manual and setup guide, tips, and investigating help. The instructional exercise on capitalizing on the Simplify3D programming is a superb method to begin with the F410. The organization has specialists remaining by at its North Carolina plant to answer your inquiries from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. They guarantee to answer email inquiries inside 60 minutes.

The Jerusalem Post Follow Jerusalem Post -- Listen Share BYEYTAN HALON Gambling software firm Playtech will pay approximately $32 million in additional tax to Israeli authorities following a civil tax audit covering a decade of activity, the company said on Wednesday. Founded in 1999 by Israeli-Cypriot multi-billionaire businessman Teddy Sagi, Playtech is a leading gambling hi-tech company developing intelligence-driven gambling software, services, content and platform technology for a range of casinos and sports betting products. The company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, issued a statement stating that it reached an agreement on December 31, 2018, to pay additional taxes worth approximately $32 million covering the fiscal years 2008 to 2017 inclusively after Israeli tax authorities “made transfer pricing adjustments in relation to certain functions performed by the Playtech group in Israel during this period.” No penalties are to be imposed as a result of the audit and the agreement will cover the entirety of the Playtech group’s activity in Israel. Payment is expected to be made in the next 30 days. In December, the company announced that Italian legislation to increase taxation on various types of gambling is expected to reduce its 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by approximately $23–28.5 million. Playtech currently employs 5,800 employees across 17 countries including Israel, and is headquartered in the Isle of Man.

https://home.ohumanity.org/alternatives-to-superintelligence-f4973cec14b5?source=tag_archive---------69-----------------------,Alternatives to Superintelligence,Surviving Superintelligence: part 4 of 4,"Surviving Superintelligence: part 4 of 4 LeeAnn Felder-Heim Follow O’Humanity -- 1 Listen Share Inpart 3we decided that it is possible for humans — through collective organizing — to exert some control over technological developments. This brought us to two important questions:Whatwould be required to impede the deployment of SI? And,Howcan we make sure that happens? Inregards to thewhatquestion, we can use nuclear monitoring and Mutually Assured Destruction as a model. If many world powers create artificially intelligent agents that are poised to crossover to HLMI and then to SI, and these world powers monitor each other and set up ICBMs to destroy HLMI agents that have been “deployed,” a stalemate could be achieved. This theory assumes that we will be able to successfully monitor HLMI development. While HLMI development cannot be monitored by environmental monitoring, advances in specialized technologies could facilitate monitoring of government entities and corporations with the capacity to develop HLMI. An analog to the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act could be enacted to criminalize private citizens developing HLMI. While monitoring all private citizens capable of developing HLMI would be challenging, the level of computing power and specialized skills required would shrink the pool significantly. You might be thinking — do we really want to create an international monitoring agency that will monitor private citizens with powerful computers?Idon’t want that. But Ireallydon’t want to jump on the Bostrom train either — pushing down the gas pedal on SI development and putting the hopes of human survival into a highly uncertain method for controlling SI. Would a global monitoring system be any less dystopic than the various possible existential catastrophes Bostrom outlines? We have accepted monitoring systems for nuclear testing, and we were close to doing the same for biological weapons — why wouldn’t we do the same for an equally terrifying threat to human survival? Side note:A halt on HLMI deployment does not mean a halt on all technological developments. Halting HLMI would not, for instance, impede important medical advances that use machine learning but are extremely specialized. These medical devices, while incredible, are not “generally intelligent,” and neither — for that matter — are self-driving cars or SIRI. Just because technologies do certain human tasks very well (e.g. driving or speech recognition), does not mean that they have Human Level Machine Intelligence (being able to do almost all human tasks as well as the average human). Inregards tohowquestion, I think that the progression of artificial intelligence improvements will naturally attract mass interest in SI.Huge numbers of people will be pushed out of jobs due to improvements in specific artificial intelligence. If those people can be made to see that mechanization is the true driving force behind their suffering — rather than being distracted by scapegoats like globalization and Mexicanization — then there might be enough anti technological advance momentum to impact political decisions. Maybe when 3.4 million Americans are replaced by self-driving vehicles mechanization’s downsides will become unavoidably obvious. But, we must not assume that it will. To impede the power of scapegoating, we need to spread this discussion to the people who will be most impacted by job loss from specialized AI. Spreading idiosyncratic discussion about SI deployment is key in preventing scapegoatingandin guiding people toward positive action. Clear understanding of SI is required for funneling energy toward the requisite international organizing that can impede its deployment. Without a clear understanding of SI, anger about the suffering caused by mechanization could easily lead to chaos. We must avoid the destructive and ineffective machine-smashing coup that ends Kurt Vonnegut’s novel,Player Piano, and instead offer effective and peaceful means for people to express their indignation.

Luana And The Lizard Girls didn’t happen, but Eno’s stated aim (to “drag together a bunch of bizarre people”) came to fruition when sessions began, two months later, for his first solo album,Here Come The Warm Jets. Listen toHere Come The Warm Jetsright now. ‎Here Come the Warm Jets by Brian Eno ‎Album · 1974 · 10 Songs. Available with an Apple Music subscription. Try it free. itunes.apple.com Not that the musicians Eno gathered around him could — or should — be described as “bizarre”, exactly: more that their disparate and contrasting styles represented a determined (and career-long) desire on Eno’s part to encourage fresh and intuitive modes of thought, eradicate boundaries, and throw the mixture up in the air and construct enduring art from the falling fragments. Among those filing into London’s Majestic Studios in September 1973 were guitarists Robert Fripp (King Crimson), Chris Spedding and Paul Rudolph (Pink Fairies), bassists John Wetton, Busta Jones and Bill MacCormick (Matching Mole), drummer Simon King (Hawkwind), and a clutch of Eno’s former Roxy Music bandmates. An all-star assemblage, but the results were mercifully free of the extended jamming one might have expected, cleaving instead to Eno’s subversive avant-pop tendencies. Here was a bold sonic statement which, in part, just about qualified as a glam curtain call, but which also hinted at enticing new avenues of expression. If theVelvet Underground-indebted ‘Needles In The Camel’s Eye’ and the malformedBo Diddleyshudder of ‘Blank Frank’ suggested an aesthete’s fascination with a particularly raw-boned arm of rock history, the suffocating, bedevilled ‘Driving Me Backwards’ trudged stoically into an all-consuming darkness. (It’s tempting also to imagine that the delirious, atonal synth manipulation of ‘The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch’ and the arch, decadent tease of ‘Dead Finks Don’t Talk’ referenced Eno’s own recent past in Roxy Music.) Throughout, Eno’s enigmatic lyrics painted playfully surreal word pictures (“Juanita and Juan, very clever with maracas” in ‘Baby’s On Fire’), or tapped a vein of waspish venom (“Oh you headless chicken, can those poor teeth take so much kicking?” in ‘Dead Finks Don’t Talk’). Released by Island Records in January 1974,Here Come The Warm Jetsrose to №26 in the UK. If Eno’s solo albums would never again trouble in the charts in quite the same manner, it goes without saying that, with further releases, plus an epochalBowiecollaboration in the wings, his sphere of influence was poised to go through the roof.

But appearances are deceptive Microfiber can rightly be called theapartment cleaningmaterial of the XXI century. Its properties are truly unique, which is why it is so often used to clean a variety of surfaces. From this material, you will learn about the history of creation, composition, characteristics, and applications of microfiber. Microfiber was developed in 1976 in Japan, but its widespread production became possible (and economically viable) only after several years. However, immediately after the invention of this unusual material in allmaid servicerespects, the world appreciated the revolutionary discovery and the opportunities that had opened up. Thecleaning servicesmaterial consists of only two substances — polyester (forming fiber) and nylon (forming the core) in a ratio of 4/1. The resulting tissue has millions of microscopic triangular pores. They quickly absorb water (ten times faster than any other material) and absorb dust using contact electrification. The liquid then evaporates quickly, and the dirt lingers in the pores of the microfiber cloth. The reason why microfiber retains dust so well is the improperly branched structure of microscopic triangular pores. This is what allows it to surpass its counterparts so much — gauze, paper, and various special cleaning materials. Microfiber has such a prefix because it is about 50 times thinner than an average human hair. Because of this, the fabric is very soft and can interact with any surface much more efficiently.",Luxury Cleaning NY,https://medium.com/@anna.frankfurt86?source=post_page---byline--1396783645f2---------------------------------------,0,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png,2019-01-01T17:36:13.685Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@eForte/5-biggest-challenges-of-iot-94d8e1f79f04?source=tag_archive---------158-----------------------,5 Biggest Challenges of IoT,Written byeForte.net,"eForte.net Follow -- Listen Share By the year 2020, the market size for the Internet of Things (IoT for short) will reach an approximate €242,222 million. Although relatively new, the field of IoT has risen dramatically during the years. But everything has its risks and security concerns especially when it comes to the field of technology. Since IoT has not yet penetrated the mainstream market, there is intense competition among the manufacturers on getting their products and devices to the consumers first. This often results in overlooking the potential security issues that can arise regarding data access and management as well as the IoT devices themselves. Below is a list of some major security concerns associated with IoT Insufficient testing and updating: As of 2018, it has been estimated that the number of IoT devices connected in connected and smart homes is 17 billion and will rise up to 20 billion by 2020. This influx of latest gadgets and devices also means that tech companies aren’t putting as much thought into the device security risks as they should have. Often many of these devices and IoT products do not get enough updates. Some of them don’t even have any updates. This results in devices that were once considered secure as the time of purchase by the customers often become less protected and may even become vulnerable to hackers and other security issues. The early computer systems suffered from this very problem. The lack of updates caused them to become prone to security risks where initially they weren’t. These issues were resolved with the automatic updates. Unfortunately, IoT manufacturers are more focused on launching and delivering their products as fast as they can, giving little thought to security. Even if manufacturers do release their firmware updates, they tend to do so only for a brief period of time which lasts the moment they start working on their next big gadget. And to make matters worse, they use unsupported legacy Linux kernels. Source:Google Images Ultimately all this results in their customers being prone to potential security attacks because of outdated hardware and software both. In order to fully secure yourself from such attacks, the manufacturers need to implement a proper testing and quality assurance system before launching their devices to the public. Furthermore, companies should remain careful in updating them regularly. The importance of updates should never be underestimated the entire reputation of the company can be at stake. It only requires one single large scale breach of data to make the customers lose their faith in the company and bring down its image. IoT malware and ransomware: Because of the expected rise inIoTdevices, it is not unfair to expect the rise of IoT malwares and ransomwares too. The traditional malwares were reliant on encryption to completely lock the users out from their devices. Now with the advent of hybridization of malwares and ransomwares, their attacks can be a lot more varied now with potentially devastating effects. For instance, a simple Internet Protocol (IP) camera can be easily accessed to capture confidential information using several locations like your home or your office. The webcam can then be locked from its user while all its data is transferred to a web address designed to browse and extract sensitive data by using the malware’s access point. Once this has been done, ransom is then demanded from the original user for unlocking the device and returning the data. While this is a textbook example of malwares and ransomwares, the rapidly growing field of IoT also enables an entire field of attacks on these devices. Source:Google Images IoT Botnets and cryptocurrency: Unless if you have been living under a rock, you would probably be aware ofcryptocurrency, even if not in too much detail. The intense mining competition and the rise in cryptocurrency is a highly tempting opportunity for hackers. Although blockchain technology was designed to prevent hacking and modification of data, there is still a steady increase in the number of attacks in several blockchain sectors. The targeted area isn’t the blockchain itself, it’s the app development which is running blockchain. There are several methods already underway to extract sensitive information, one of which is social engineering. Through this method, confidential information like usernames, passwords, private keys are being hacked. Cryptocurrencies are also being mined with IoT devices. Monero is an example of the many open source cryptocurrency that can be mined from these devices. There have been several cases of hackers having repurposed IP and video cameras for mining cryptocurrencies. IoT devices and applications need to be constantly updated and regulated if we are to counter the threat of these exploitation methods. The field of cryptocurrency is already quite unpredictable and data manipulation can result in flooding the crypto-market and cause havoc. Brute forcing and default passwords: One of the most prominent cases of brute forcing was the Mirai malware which was used in some of the largest DDoS attacks to the devices that were shipped with default passwords. The customers were not instructed to change the default usernames and passwords when they were received. While there are indeed some governmental reports that advise companies against selling IoT devices with default usernames and passwords like “admin”, these reports are simply considered mere guidelines for which there isn’t any legal action. Nor are there any incentives for companies to forgo this practice. These weak credentials make all the IoT devices prone to password hacking, especially the brute force method. Source:Google Images Privacy and security: Today’s world of inter-connectivity with practically everyone has both facilitated the communication process and has also created a whole range of security threats. Data is in a constant flux of being stored and processed every second by companies and businesses of every type on multiple platforms including IoT devices like smart TVs, HVAC systems, smart thermostats, connected printers, speakers and lighting systems and many more. Unfortunately it is a fact that most of our data is shared or sold between companies which is quite clearly a breach of privacy and is a criminal act. Not only does it allow unauthorized access to our personal info but it also destroys a company’s image and the trust it had built with its customers. To ensure that sensitive information is not being distributed, there should be a stricter implementation of the privacy policies. Another way is to redact and anonymize sensitive data prior to storing it on IoT devices which may be used to identify the individual owning them. Similar practices can be applied for mobile applications, services and other electronic devices which store and utilize data in some form or another. It is recommended for a company that handles sensitive information to go through a directory of mobile and web application development companies that can help you in ensuring data security and can prevent breaches and attacks. These cyber security companies, provided that you opt for a good, reliable one, can go a long way to protect your data. Although IoT devices have yet to reach their full penetration of the mass market, their development is making progress by leaps and bounds. It won’t be long that IoT becomes a household term just like today’s smartphones are.

https://medium.com/@NabilAdam/changing-healthcare-with-informatics-a0aca1088475?source=tag_archive---------177-----------------------,Changing Healthcare with Informatics,Written byNabil Adam,"Nabil Adam Follow -- Listen Share Healthcare Informatics has brought around a large amount of change within the Healthcare industry. The creation of new technology continues to impact and reshape the industry while improving the way doctors provide medical care. The benefits from each technological achievement work to bring us into a better future in healthcare, while eliminating systems that clearly do not provide the most accurate information. Healthcare Informatics has taken the place of medical records and different healthcare systems to streamline the industry. Many of the developments are physical changes we can see such as new programs and systems for medical records and patient to physician interactions. Aside from the physical, there are other changes that continue to benefit and make way for the successful future of healthcare informatics. Patients Taking Interest In Their HealthA great improvement that has been seen over the years informatics have been implemented, is the increase of patients taking an interest in their own health. Because patients now have access to their medical records and diagnoses, they’ve been more apt to stay up to date on appointments, which medications they should be taking, as well as their diagnoses and symptoms. This is also true in the fact that through patient portals, patients are able to speak directly to their doctors and nurses when they have any questions, concerns, or need something such as a refill on medication. Knowledge and Communication Has IncreasedThere are so many different specialists in the healthcare industry that most patients are seeing multiple physicians on a yearly basis for different reasons. A huge advancement with healthcare informatics is how connected medical professionals are. Communication and sharing of information among each physician helps to provide patients with the best care possible. Keeping all information in one place that is easily accessible provides the knowledge needed to diagnose and treat patients with less unanswered questions and decreases the possibility for a misdiagnosis. The best outcome from healthcare informatics is the increased level of quality care. Freeing up time from our medical professionals by having new technology and healthcare information systems creates not only quality care, but safer care for patients. With proper diagnosis’ and efficiency from medical staff, insurance companies, hospitals, and patients all save money in the long run. Thecontinued growth of healthcare technologywill transform the future of the medical industry.

Vi Nguyen Follow Austin Startups -- Share I originally asked this question to several founders with the intent of addressing angel investors but I’ve found it doesn’t exclude other institutional investors either. If you Google “fundraising startups” you’ll find thousands of articles on how to get started, what you should do and how you should communicate to investors. What many first time entrepreneurs don’t learn till later is that it’s not a one way street. Founders need to do just as much due diligence on their investors as is done on their company. Even fewer realize that fundraising etiquette runs both ways. Here is advice that I either learned through experience or had other founders share their stories. The number one frustration that each founder has experienced is ghosting from an interested investor. Helena Fogarty atMi OlaActive Swimwear expressed, “Ghosting really sucks. We’d all rather hear ‘I’ve decided no.’ or ‘Now is not the right time for me,’ than the ghost.” Everyone values their time and it shows a lot more respect for the other person to not be strung along.

https://medium.com/@Kitun/flat-organization-just-works-how-punchkicks-method-helps-it-flourish-d9710e18ac9a?source=tag_archive---------159-----------------------,“Flat Organization just works” — How Punchkick’s method helps it flourish,Written byScott Kitun,"Scott Kitun Follow -- Listen Share “It’s crazy. It just works,” says Zak Dabbas of the “flat” organizational structure behind his digital marketing agency,Punchkick Interactive. “Flat just means that everybody has the same opportunity to grow.” For Zak, flat isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a reflection of his personal journey. Zak was pre-med in college, intending to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a physician. But life had other plans. “My last year, I got testicular cancer. I went through chemo, all of it,” he says. It was a nightmare. I had this moment where I was like, I don’t want to be in hospitals for the rest of my life. That’s not my passion.” So Zak did what he thought was the next best thing: law school. While getting his JD, Zak and his now-business-partner began building digital projects on the side, for “weekend money,” he says. Soon, he realized that his side hustle was what really lit him up. “I thought, this is the only thing I like,” Zak says. “The only thing I’m excited about is the digital work we do.” “So in the middle of law school, we got a website up, got some spec projects on it, and I started firing off new business emails. By the time I graduated, we had landed two Fortune-level clients. I walked into the law firm where I was working at the time and said, ‘smell you later. I’m outta here.’ And I never looked back.” Zak’s roundabout path to creative agency CEO has given him a unique perspective on leadership. “Because I had been beaten and battered by all these other industries I was in previously — especially in law — when I started Punchkick, I wanted it to be a safe place,” he says. “The philosophy behind it was always flat. I hired people that I really liked, respected, and admired, who I would want to work with. Because, I have one life to live. I’m going to enjoy this.” Zak sees the culture of Punchkick as its key differentiator in the vast digital marketing landscape. The team of about 40 is run without managers or other traditional hierarchical roles. New employees choose their own title, based on their skill set and experience. Company financials and client health project statuses are completely transparent. Daily morning huddles create a close-knit atmosphere. An agile workflow keeps things humming along. “This company has grown to become almost like a group of mini-CEOs,” Zak says. “It’s unbelievable — the initiatives that happen internally and organically. What our clients hopefully find is that the team is so dedicated and intelligent. It’s really nice to have a company where everybody can deliver so much value.” Zak credits Frederic Laloux’s groundbreaking book “Reinventing Organizations,”which applies concepts of mindfulness and human evolution to model a more “soulful” workplace. “It’s the only book I’ll ever plug,” says Zak. “I don’t really ever read business books, but it’s great.” Flat organization isn’t the only thing that sets Punchkick apart. The agency stands out with a user-oriented approach. “The processes we have are really solid. We’ve been around. We know what we’re doing. But we’re not trusting of ourselves. We trust the audience. So we don’t build projects or products without actually doing user research and testing, and really hearing that it’s a winning product.” To date, Punchkick’s clients include Harley-Davidson, Walmart, Microsoft, Allstate, and Intuit. One of Zak’s favorite projects is their design and development ofMarriott’sflagship e-commerce app. Making humongous clients like Marriott ecstatic takes top-notch talent, Zak says. Clearly he’s able to attract it because of the culture he’s created at Punchkick. I have conversations with companies looking for tech talent all day, every day. Take note: if you don’t follow Zak’s lead and foster an environment where people get to work together as a unit, you’re going to have a very hard time hiring and keeping the best people. Siloing is not just a culture issue; it’s boxing yourself in. Zak agrees: “the quality of work suffers,” he says. How does Punchkick keep everyone accountable without management? Transparency. “I don’t hide anything,” Zak says. “And I feel like it just results in people I can really trust. Because there’s so much transparency, people don’t want to let down their peers.” Originally published attechnori.comon January 2, 2019.",Scott Kitun,https://medium.com/@Kitun?source=post_page---byline--d9710e18ac9a---------------------------------------,0,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6HdOPY0TL2Qv0czaYxxgMw@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*6HdOPY0TL2Qv0czaYxxgMw@2x.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*6HdOPY0TL2Qv0czaYxxgMw@2x.jpeg,2019-03-28T16:51:01.201Z,Medium

In this article, I’ll look over the ugliest and strangest iPhone concepts that I can pull from the depths of the internet. Get ready to vomit. Obviously ,this was an iPhone 5 concept. I think what makes it really ugly is partly the square home button, wider screen, and plastic/rubber volume buttons. I don’t think we’ve ever seen an iPhone that can fit 5 apps side to side, and I know that at least since the iPhone 4 we have had metal volume buttons, and obviously only had two styles of home buttons — ever. This phone was given the strange name of the iPhone 3GSRE, to be launched after the 5S. It almost looks like an iPhone 4, but obviously ,this was made before the 5S (Pre iOS 7 design and home button with a square in it). What I find weird about this phone is also the volume buttons, I don’t think we’ve had an iPhone with volume buttons with a dip in it. This was an iPhone 3GS concept. This concept has so many things wrong with it. From the antenna bands to the somehow off looking home button, the centered camera, and front camera and earpiece. I cannot even stand to talk about all of the problems that I see, from this pre-Spotify looking Spotify, the Phonify on the back (probably just the name of the renderer) and how big the screen would be from scale of the icons at the top. This phone….. noMostly looks, possible other than the earpiece, bezels and home button… so basically the three things that define the iPhone look. Burn this image. Burn it. The ¨iPhone 4G¨ This phone. Itś not nearly as bad as the others look, but the lock screen, clock, ring around the Apple logo, earpiece and bottom side of the device. There is also the fact of the bezel inside the bezel. The iPhone 4G…. again. The scale is also very off to me, how small the camera is to the back of the phone and the bezel inside the bezel again…. also what even are those bars on the side? Antennas? Removable battery? There is also the terrible looking center front camera. The iPhone 3G Nano.I remember using the original iPod Nano. This reminds me of it, but it just doesnt look like an iPhone, and I doubt it would feel anything like one in the hand. Now, here is where it gets interesting. I think people got used to new designs every 2 generations of iPhones. There was the 3G, then 3GS, then a redesign to the 4’s design. Then there was the 4’s design to the 5’s design, then to the 6's design. So there might have been a pattern. That pattern of what people are to expect I think really rubbed off on the iPhone 7 rumours. Instead of writing a paragraph about each, i’ll just end the article with a few iPhone 7 concept arts/renders.",Lil Ramen,https://medium.com/@LilRamenCHS?source=post_page---byline--9bf007cfd594---------------------------------------,0,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg,2019-01-03T23:34:22.837Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@TheDigitalTP/keeping-up-with-the-speed-of-business-9927c150aa1c?source=tag_archive---------178-----------------------,Keeping up with the speed of business,Written byThe Digital Transformation People,"The Digital Transformation People Follow -- Listen Share As we bid farewell to 2018 and look ahead to the next 12 months, it is no surprise to hear that things will only progress more quickly. Leading enterprise robotic process automation (RPA) software company, UiPath, predicts that “everything will be accelerated in 2019”. The company has newly released its top five predictions from some of its senior leaders. Kulpreet Singh, managing director EMEA, reckons the pace of automation will increase as large-scale RPA implementations advance rapidly in the region. He says they will be “turbo-charged” by the spread of expertise through widely available training programmes, new open marketplaces and the maturation of internal centres-of-excellence. Singh adds that such implementations will progress more quickly in the EMEA region than other parts of the world, especially when it comes to deploying attended software robots in a wide range of settings. UiPath also forecasts that automation will be “democratised” through global vendor education initiatives and that senior executives will back RPA and it will be easier to gain senior executive sponsorship for automation because its benefits have become so obvious. While the predictions have far-reaching effects for workplaces and the world of business, they are both positive and indicative of howtechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and roboticsare being embedded into workplaces and work practices. There is still a great deal to be done and those leaders that have distanced themselves from digital transformation programmes must roll up their sleeves and get stuck into what needs to be done to advance their organisations into the digital era. Surveys will continue to be published and headlines were written that warn AI and machine learning will mean loss of jobs and bring major changes that may initially alarm people but we also now know that these technologies will create new roles. It will not be plain-sailing though and not every organisation will get it right the first time. A recent online post I read complained about how an airline’s staff stood by while passengers using the self-service struggled to lift heavy bags and sort boarding passes. As you’d expect, the writer was rightly angered by this and it reinforced their view of the pitfalls of self-service. This was not the fault of the self-service system though but a failure of leadership that the staff didn’t have a mindset to help customers. Not only does it scream of poor customer service but also of badly implemented automation. So while the pace of technological development means that things will only get faster, it is down to us as leaders to make sure they also get better. Finally, it remains for me to say thank you to everyone who has read and commented on my blogs during 2018 and to wish you all a very happy Christmas and New Year.

Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019 React still hasmuch higher satisfaction ratings than Angularfor the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The newReact hooks APIreplaced theclassAPI I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (TheclassAPI still works, but the hooks API is reallymuch better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (seedetails), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. Data Sources We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: Google Search trends.Not my favorite indicator, but good for a big picture view. Package Downloads.The aim here is to catch real users in the act of using the framework. Job board postings from Indeed.com.Using the same methodology from previous years for consistency. Google Search Trends React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package Downloads Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScriptacross all sectors (including the enterprise)is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy appsnever upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous yearscombined. Job Board Postings Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year,we tally the job postings¹mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: React: 24,640 Angular: 19,032 jQuery: 14,272 Vue: 2,816 Ember (not pictured): 2,397 Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we needqualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. Methodology:Job searches were conducted on Indeed.com. To weed out false positives, I paired searches with the keyword “software” to strengthen the chance of relevance, and then multiplied by ~1.5 (roughly the difference between programming job listings that use the word “software” and those that don’t.) All SERPS were sorted by date and spot checked for relevance. The resulting figures aren’t 100% accurate, but they’re good enough for the relative approximations used in this article. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic:“Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. On TypeScript TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated becausetype safety does not appear to be a real thing(does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), andtype inferencein JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in atransducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s.

That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations ofthe internet of value.Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read“Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. Other Tech to Watch As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learningis in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applicationsare quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively usethe Twitter PWA instead. AR(Augmented Reality)VR(Virtual Reality)MR(Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to becomeXR(eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous VehiclesAutonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computingprogressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent reportputs things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

A helpful ad on Google will match a searcher’s keywords with a relevant landing page, but redirect ads provide counter-messaging and often alternative destinations that go against the search words. For example, if you search Google for “iPhone 6S,” you’re predictably going to be shown an ad for the iPhone 6S. By clicking that ad, you’ll probably land on a page where you can buy one. A redirect ad, however, might twist your search and prompt you with something like this for a Galaxy S6 instead: In this example, Samsung is trying to swerve the searcher’s intent with counter-messaging and is betting the searcher will question their brand loyalty, click the ad, and convert from Apple to Samsung. It’s one thing to (fairly obviously) redirect an ad in a smartphone search. But what if the redirection was a bit harder to detect?

Article 11 and Article 13 which have gained the nicknames “link tax” and “meme ban” respectively. Together they make up the European Union Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. This has been primarily created to limit how copyrighted content is shared online. Article 13 basically just states that internet companies like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn e.t.c will be sanctioned when a user posts copyrighted material on their platform. Because of the fear of sanctions, everything you post on the internet will go through heavy scrutiny and will most likely be disallowed. This means no more memes, playing songs in the background of your videos, posting educational or funny videos you found on the internet e.t.c Previously it was the job of the content owner (record labels, directors, photographers e.t.c) to find and report use of their material but now it has become the job of the platform owner (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn e.t.c) to prevent it. How does this affect people outside the EU? Well most social networks just adhere to the strictest rules available and implement it across all their systems regardless of the geographic location. After the implementation of GDPR regulations I’m sure you got notifications of updated privacy policies on all major platforms you use even though you don’t live in a country under the EU…. Well that’s how it works. Could this be the death of the internet as we know it?

https://medium.com/grapecity/using-shadow-dom-how-to-build-your-own-shadow-elements-2b2e8cd34502?source=tag_archive---------73-----------------------,Using Shadow DOM (How to Build Your Own Shadow Elements),A Quick Example of Shadow DOM,"MESCIUS inc. Follow MESCIUS inc. -- Listen Share Shadow DOM may have a name that conjures images of a dark world. But it’s actually an interesting feature of modern browsers — allowing for easy encapsulation of DOM elements and smart web components. If you‘re a front-end developer, you’ll likely benefit from understanding how Shadow DOM works and what it can do for you. The easiest way to explain what Shadow DOM does is to demonstrate an example of Shadow DOM in action. A Quick Example of Shadow DOM The easiest way to explain what Shadow DOM does is to demonstrate an example of Shadow DOM in action. Let’s take a look at a range input type, a DOM element that requires its own DOM subtree for proper rendering (something that can differ wildly between browsers): <input type=""range"" /> That seems like a simple enough element. But what makes the data input type interesting is that, when rendered, it appears like a slider instead of a standard text input — despite the fact that a slider doesn’t appear anywhere in the main document’s DOM: This sub-element, with no apparent DOM associated with it in the browser inspector or via JavaScript, is the Shadow DOM. It’s a DOM subtree that we can’t access via conventional means in order to better encapsulate complex functionality not typically associated with traditional HTML pages. One interesting thing to note is that, while JavaScript events are retargeted to the parent element in order to avoid exposing access to the internal Shadow DOM elements, these same elements can be interacted with using CSS as long as you know what the elements are and how to access them. But, as cool as it is, how can we best utilize the Shadow DOM in our own projects? Before we can build our own Shadow DOM element, we must first learn to speak the language. At its core, each Shadow DOM element is composed of three parts: a host, a tree, a boundary, and a root. Shadow Host The Shadow Host is the DOM node that the Shadow DOM element is attached to. In the case of our slider above, this would be the input tag. Shadow Tree The Shadow Tree is the entire DOM tree inside the Shadow DOM. Looking back to our slider, this would be everything that makes up the track and icon. Shadow Boundary The Shadow Boundary is the place where the Shadow DOM ends, and the main document DOM begins [insert Lion King reference here]. Shadow Root And finally, the Shadow Root. This element is the root node of the Shadow Tree. Building your own shadow elements is a surprisingly straightforward task in standard JavaScript. All it takes to attach a Shadow DOM to an element is to call the attachShadow() method on that element, and then building and attaching the internal elements as you would any other DOM element: It is important to point out that the attachShadow() method accepts an options object as its only parameter, and that object contains only one potential option: mode. The mode option specifies whether or not the shadow element can be accessed from the JavaScript written to the main document. While it may be tempting to use a closed mode, generally speaking, it is much more hassle than it’s worth to deal with a closed shadow element when an open element still provides the encapsulation benefit that comes with the Shadow DOM. Because none of the code inside a Shadow DOM element can affect anything outside of it, the Shadow DOM is an excellent tool for encapsulation. In some circumstances, obscuring elements may be used as well; however, this method is hardly foolproof, so you are better off reaping the benefits of the encapsulation and management features instead. While the Shadow DOM operates… in the shadows… it is hardly a rare thing.

Fisher Follow Job Advice for Software Engineers -- 25 Share Asking what should be on a resume is one of the most common questions I hear. I’ve seen thousands of resumes, interviewed hundreds, and hired or helped hire dozens, so I’ll describe exactly what I’m looking for when I’m presented with your application. Resume or CV? In the US, documents describing your qualifications and work history are called résumés. In the EU and elsewhere known as a curriculum vitae, or CV. Either way, the purpose is the same: a relatively short document which summarizes your skills, work history, education, contact information, and anything else that can be used to estimate your “fit” for a given position. I’m based in the US, so I’ll give a US-centric view of resumes, but I’ll attempt to point out differences with CVs in areas in which I’m familiar. Why do I need one? A resume is required as part of almost every job application. If you see a job listing online and click “Apply,” the next page will almost certainly ask you for your contact information and a resume file. Yes, getting a job is a highly-subjective process that involves interviewing and negotiation, but providing an employer with a resume is the standard first step before any of that can happen.",James S.

It’s time to rethink why, what, and how we teach.","The digital revolution is at a tipping point. It’s time to rethink why, what, and how we teach. Joe Brooks Follow Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators -- Listen Share By ERIK P.M. VERMEULIN Reinventing education is a challenging but urgent task. We are witnessing an exponential growth of technology. Artificial intelligence, sensors, data-analytics, and blockchain (to name a few) are amplifying and accelerating each other. This will lead to new applications across all areas of the economy and society in 2019. In a digital age, any new approach to education needs to adopt a more “skills-based” focus that aims to build creativity. After all, we (and in particular the next generation) must be prepared to live and work more closely with intelligent, networked machines. The main focus of education shouldn’t be on the transfer of knowledge of standardized processes and procedures (these will certainly be automated) but on cultivating innovative and creative skills that cannot easily be replicated by machines. In a world of smart technologies, a premium will be put on the most human of qualities; our capacity for unique and highly personalized forms of self-expression. And all education needs to be re-organized around this goal. I have written about this issue before, but I want to make it more concrete for 2019. Think about it as my New Year’s resolution. We need to get more serious about teaching the skills relevant for a digital age. We need to get more serious about teaching the skills relevant for a digital age. I’ve already made significant changes to my courses, focusing more on developing student creativity. But next year, I want to go even further by introducing three “new” components: (1) “multidisciplinary collaboration,” (2) “visionary thinking,” and (3) “EdTech.” The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was the starting point for the process-oriented and proceduralized society we know today. Standardized product development, manufacturing and supply chain processes created efficiencies and led to economic growth and social welfare. Specialization became important. Of course, people still had to work in teams, but each discipline had its responsibilities, and team members relied on each other to bring a unique expertise to the table. Teamwork and collaboration are also crucial to the development of digital technologies and their applications. However, the transition from products to services and the shift in business models from “pipes” (where products are being continually pushed out to consumers) to “platforms” (where stakeholders are creating services/value together) entails that co-creation has become much more important. This means that “multidisciplinary teams” work more closely together. This means that everyone needs to operate beyond their specialty. This has had an enormous impact on team dynamics. Team members need a different skillset in the so-called platform economy. To co-create, it is vital that the members speak each other’s’ language, or at least understand one another. A more open and curious mindset has become a pre-requisite to the success of all teams. Multidisciplinary collaboration must be taught. It needs to become a mandatory part of every curriculum at any level or age. Of course, we still need specialists, but more than ever they have to be open-minded, be able to listen and master the skills to collaborate and communicate effectively. There are plenty of examples of technological disruption. But after watching this Coldfusion video on YouTube, it became clear that companies are not being disrupted by the technologies themselves. Instead, they suffer from a lack of “vision.” When confronted with new technological developments/new technologies (even when they are offered to them), CEOs and other executives point to a long list of inefficiencies concerning the usability, reliability, and adaptability of the new technologies. The telephone was just a “toy.” Television was “boring” (compared to the cinema experience). The energy use of computers was off the charts, preventing it from becoming a mainstream product. Modern smartphones didn’t have a “real keyboard” (and were thus not suitable for business people). In each case, the executives didn’t see the potential of new technologies to disrupt established markets and to become commercially attractive. In each case, there was a failure of vision. Of course, it is too simple to say that we need more visionaries. History shows that these visionaries (who were in theApple Think Different campaignmore than twenty years ago referred to as “the rebels, the troublemakers, the crazy ones, or the geniuses”) are hard to find. This doesn’t mean that we should not pay more attention to the creation of new and fresh perspectives in our educational programs. Again, we are at a tipping point. Technological disruption has become “normalized” and a routine part of everyday work and life. The consequences of the technological revolution go much further than the disruption of a company. Ignoring the speed and magnitude of the disruptive potential of digital technologies could be “catastrophic.” It is, therefore, necessary to teach students the capacity to develop constantly a fresh and new perspective and to revisit the wisdom of the often long-held assumptions, theories, and business models. That is not to say that these models are always wrong, but the capacity for critical thinking helps the students to maintain an open and fresh view of the world. With the developments in artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies (such as blockchain), maintaining a fresh perspective has become a must-have skill. We need more diversity rather than people that know how to follow and execute processes and procedures.

We need more diversity rather than people that know how to follow and execute processes and procedures. The re-education of Economics 101 On a dreary Wednesday lunchtime in October, more than 300 students are packed into one of University College London’s… qz.com EdTech (or education technology) has a broad definition. It includes everything from the straightforward use of computers to entire online teaching platforms, mobile learning applications, gamification and augmented and virtual reality solutions. In short, it aims to use digital technologies to disrupt education. EdTech companies have been around for about a decade now. Companies in this area started to attract attention from angels, venture capitalists and other risk capital investors in 2010. Looking at the investment data, it appears that there is already a decline in interest in EdTech. Yet, EdTech companies can be expected to generate more attention in 2019. But when I discuss developments in EdTech with my colleagues, it appears that they are still far from up to speed with the latest technologies. The EdTech industry is currently dominated by technologists without the necessary educational experience. But I expect that educators will become more involved next year. For sure, their attitude towards EdTech need to change. It creates significant opportunities to deliver the combination of technological, collaborative and vision-based skills that are necessary in a digital age. What is more important is that EdTech solutions are necessary to develop a learning architecture that helps kickstart the criticalcycle of self-learning. And mastering the cycle of self-learning is essential to enable students to learn continually, study and adapt to the new technological developments. I am currently working on setting up partnerships with “EdTech” companies that integrate “EdTech” solutions and strategies in my program/courses. Multidisciplinary collaborations will be stimulated by organizing “hackathons” and other assignments. Teaching “visionary thinking” will be more challenging. One thing is certain. To “produce” thinkers, I need to behave less like a traditional teacher pushing out knowledge to students. I will act more as an influencer and co-creator inspiring students to think and challenge traditional assumptions and models. Grades will largely depend on the way the fresh and new perspectives are explained and supported. I very much look forward to the in-class experience in 2019.

https://medium.com/swlh/building-the-solar-plant-of-the-future-with-cloud-technologies-66be12adcb3c?source=tag_archive---------74-----------------------,Building the solar plant of the future with cloud technologies,"This story is published inThe Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.","Daniele Polencic Follow The Startup -- Listen Share Demand for renewable energy has been growing steadily in the last decade, with solar power outstripping the growth in all other renewable forms of power generation. Solar panels are getting cheaper, and are becoming an economically viable source of renewable energy in many parts of the world. In addition to businesses and governments, individuals are increasingly finding that installing solar power arrays is viable at a lower scale. Capturing the optimal amount of energy from a solar panel is, however, a tricky business. In order for solar panels to operate efficiently, they need to be kept clean and pointed at an optimal angle to the sun that balances power generation and prevents overheating. So how do you keep everything under control and get notified when something isn’t right and requires your attention? One solution is to capitalise on small embedded devices that measure the performance and efficiency of the cells monitor the environment drive the actuators to track the sun during the day The embedded computer collects data and sends them to a central location where is then aggregated, processed and stored. If the solar panel is dropping in efficiency, an operator can be alerted to take action. In larger plants, the solar arrays’ data are passed through a wired network, but it’s not uncommon to see those embedded computers connecting wirelessly. Imagine controlling your solar panels over 5G:the beauty of not having to deal with extra cables and the horror of long responses, dropped connections and timeouts. In a setup like that, deploying and managing applications becomes a real challenge. If you’re managing hundreds or thousands of devices, it’s not practical to attend every device in person in order to install software and firmware updates. You should design a system that can be updated remotely. Ideally, you should design a mechanism to package software that has almost zero overhead without sacrificing portability. Something small and efficient. Something that will last for years to come and transmit data securely to prevent malicious actors from damaging your infrastructure. Communication should be encrypted everywhere. But how? Designing a secure cluster is no small feat, particularly at a solar installation that can span a wide area, making it hard to protect the perimeter from trespassers who could gain physical access to your devices to extract secrets. How do you protect against that? Even if you have security sorted and rolled out a strategy to take care of software and firmware updates, you have still a long way to go. You still have to create a service to aggregate and process the data, design a dashboard for visualisations, set up alerts and monitoring and a control plane to drive coordinated changes. What initially seems like a fun weekend project becomes a major effort in distributed systems engineering. Companies exist that specialise in designing and installing software for solar plants. Should you surrender and buy prepackaged software? Never. So how can you compete with an established business with years of experience? By playing smart. Building an internet of things at scale, such as at the scale of a solar plant, shares plenty of commonalities with building cloud infrastructure. Elastic Container Service (ECS), a product from Amazon Web Services, can deploy applications across several servers. It’s designed so that you install an agent on the worker computer, which communicates with a master node that is in charge of scheduling workloads. You tell ECS what to deploy and the software on the master node instructs one of the agents to download and run it. That sounds a lot like what you want to do with your solar panels. You want to have an agent installed on each embedded computer, and you want to manage applications from a central location. But ECS is Amazon only, and you can’t take advantage of it on your hardware. What you need is an open source version of ECS. Enter Kubernetes. Kubernetes is similar to ECS: you install an agent called the kubelet on your devices, which communicates with a Kubernetes master, forming a cluster. From that moment onwards your devices are acting as one, and you can schedule deployments and manage applications. This time, however, you’re not locked in. Kubernetes is a major open source effort which you’re free to download, customise and contribute to. Is it secure? Communication between the kubelet and the master node is secured using TLS. Each node can be provisioned with its own certificate, so even if one node is compromised, you can reject only a single certificate while keeping the rest of the cluster available. And even better, the community has a wealth of shared resources regarding good practices on how to secure your cluster, gleaned from thousands of real-world Kubernetes deployments. You should check outthese collections ofkubernetes security best practicesto see what I mean. Now, if only it had a way to roll-out updates… Kubernetes doesn’t know how to deploy applications written in C, Java or Node.js. In fact, it doesn’t know how to deploy applications at all. That’s not useful, is it? Kubernetes is only able to deploy Linux containers — that’s why it’s also called a ‘container orchestrator’. Containers are essentially archives — similar to zip files. To run the container you unpack the archive and run the application as a process on the host. You probably don’t want processes to interfere with one another, so Linux containers have a nice feature where each process is isolated from the others. So instead of developing your mechanism to distribute applications, you can: Ask Kubernetes to schedule a deployment Wait for the agent on each node (the kubelet) to pick up the task Let the kubelet download the archive and run it as an isolated process. Containers are also designed to be efficient. When you update your package and wish to redistribute it, you can only ship the difference between the previous and the current container. When the delta is received, the new package is recomputed from the diff, unzipped and run as a separate process. Linux containers and Kubernetes are an excellent platform to run applications on your internet of things. In fact, installing Kubernetes in your solar plant lets you benefit from: a centralised scheduler to issue deployments secure and encrypted updates delivered as containers a proven technology able to scale to thousands of devices So what happens when a solar panel breaks? Kubernetes continually watches your infrastructure for failing processes and agents. When a device fails, Kubernetes will reschedule all of the applications deployed on that computer to another. If one of the application fails, perhaps because of a memory leak, Kubernetes will restart the app a predetermined number of times. Kubernetes is designed with the understanding that nodes cannot be expected to continue working forever, so has a design that is self-healing; it is always observing the current state of the infrastructure and takes action whenever it detects that this doesn’t match the desired state of the infrastructure. Where it finds a discrepancy, for example, if there isn’t enough capacity to run all of your apps, it will ask the cloud provider to provision more compute resources. Kubernetes is excellent for deploying containers in a way that maximises the efficiency of your infrastructure. When you deploy three instances of an application, those are scheduled to maximise efficiency. There’s no guarantee that three instances of your applications will end up on five different devices. They could all be deployed on the same node, or they could be deployed across two nodes, depending on the physical resources available. Particularly in the embedded world where resources are scarce, you don’t want deployments to be placed just anywhere. You want to have a strict set of rules for deployments. As an example, each solar panel should have only one app running at any given time. In the case of an application responsible for tilting the solar panels to track the trajectory of the sun, you don’t want to have two applications deployed on the same node that is trying to drive the same motor. Kubernetes can use several strategies to allocate containers to your nodes. The most straightforward strategy is aDeployment. In aDeployment, you specify the number of instances of your application and Kubernetes will find the space to allocate them. This is the most common deployment type, but while it’s useful for cloud deployments where you don’t care which specific node is running our application (you just care that it’s being run bysomething), this is less useful in the embedded world. Other strategies includeStatefulSetandReplicaSet. Each of them comes with different trade-offs but doesn’t serve our goal of having our application run on every available node. For this, you need aDaemonSet, a strategy that deploys one application per node. If you add a new IoT-connected solar panel to the cluster, Kubernetes will automatically schedule and deploy the application on that embedded device (node) too. So far so good. You have: packaged applications as Linux containers a centralised way to distribute software securely and incrementally strategies to deploy applications across all devices (to prioritise hardware access), or across as few as possible (to maximise efficiency) a reliable platform that self-heals when there are failures Considering that you started from nothing, you’re now in a pretty good place.

Get new content straight to your inbox and level up your expertise in Kubernetes.Subscribe now In June 2018 Redmonk wrote an article suggesting thatToyota runs Kubernetes in their cars. You can imagine each small component in your car such as the dashboard, the radio functions or the side lights having their computer with a Kubernetes agent installed. The components are connected and can communicate using the internal network. The kubernetes master is in charge of making sure that the services are always up and running, as well as scheduling deployments. Need to replace the dashboard? Just replace the component and Kubernetes will schedule the software to run on the embedded computer. Adding a GPS? No problem. Join the device to the cluster and start streaming the data. In the beginning, it might sound odd. But if you think about it, it makes sense. You have to connect those components and orchestrate them. You can’t have the front lights disconnected from the dashboard. But it turned out that it wasn’t right. Toyota didn’t run Kubernetes in their cars, but they used Kubernetes as part of their backend services. Once you connect the car to one of their diagnostic tools, the data is extracted from the vehicle and ingested into a Kubernetes cluster that’s designed to run in the cloud. A few days after the article’s publication, Redmonk amended the article to clarify this. Even if the story was untrue and was just a result of a misunderstanding, it still makes you think. What if? And what’s stopping you from using Kubernetes in a solar plant? Or in any other internet of things device? You could solve some of the hard challenges such as securing communications, delivering incremental updates and centrally controlling your fleet. You could have the best time to market for your internet of things. Hundreds of days of development saved because you can reuse a proven tool. While Kubernetes was initially designed to run in data centres, its applications go well beyond the cloud, and it won’t take long before the news come out of kubernetes used in another internet of things setup.

I was warming up to contribute to my team. Somehow, I caught myself having very interesting thoughts while going through the existing code base. My team had built this code base over months and years of effort. As my first task, I had a small bug fix that would help in stabilizing future versions of the service. My team explained the architecture of the service to me and where do we fit in the grand scheme of the larger project. It was on me to find where the code had to be added/deleted or modified to make the bug fix. I started digging through the code base, most of which had been created in the last two years. By no standard, it was legacy code. As I went deeper and deeper into it, I found myself with quite profane thoughts. To say that code was not aesthetically pleasing, would be a mild way to put it. This is how I reacted to my team’s code base: This sucks!!! Yuck, there is two hundred line function here. Who wrote this crap! Oh God, there is an if-else block inside an if-else block. This code is a big hairy mess! eff it. This needs to be rewritten from scratch. I was furious. As I was having these thoughts, a part of me was wondering, could there be a way to make some sense of all this? Were there some things I didn’t know that these senior guys on my team who wrote most of this code. I began to find out. I grabbed the senior guy on my team for a quick chat and started throwing my questions at him. From what I came to know after the discussion was very enlightening for me. The team was aware that code had some maintenance problems. However, the existing code base was in the shape it is for a few reasons. As he went on to explain those reasons to me, I could see whythis postmakes sense. Read on to find the answer to why when you ask any software developer the quality of code they are working on, the default response is: “It’s a mess”. And also, why building things up from the ground is not a solution in most cases. Code is written for a different reason Most people new to software development, including me, think that code is written for machines. Wrong. Nada. It was written for humans. The machine doesn’t even see the JavaScript code that you write, all they see is a sequence of 0s and 1s. And as the service for my team was being built up, there were real deadlines with deliverables that had to be delivered. Software developers are already very mentally taxed. Somewhere in the pressure to deliver, getting the code to work takes priority over writing super aesthetically pleasing code. A large chunk of code is easier to write and explain to a fellow developer in person, as opposed to hopping from one file to another to make sense of things. These decisions then can remain around for a long time. Production code is battle tested My team gets a lot of incident reports, which sometimes lead to critical bug fixes in the code. An error handling if-else clause here, a try-catch there, and suddenly, the whole code base has grown hairs. This is how code base starts to get messier despite best intentions. This is exactly why rewriting code from the ground up is such a naive idea. This would result in throwing away all the bug fixes and improvements that were made. These were accumulated over the course of months and years, possibly by a user having some real issue. A developer might have spent several hours to fix these bugs once they were reported. What works is the way In the world of business, where there might be clients depending on your product or service. No one cares if your code is refactored to the best possible extent. Every line of code is written to solve a business problem. Ask yourself, what value will your refactoring efforts create? Possibly none, and they might end up introducing more bugs. Plus, is it the best use of your time? The first step is to recognize the problem. The issue was my ego was thinking it could do a better job than these senior developers who clearly didn’t know how to write production level code. This is a very naive way of thinking, and I have been burnt sufficient times in the past to avoid it now. Just by acknowledging your ego’s presence, you gain a huge advantage over it. Suddenly, it has no place to hide. Acknowledging the problem is one thing, and solving it is another. Below is my way of getting around this knee-jerk reaction. If you have a different way, write it down in the comments section. Get Curious Start to ask why! Why was this piece of code written this way? Who wrote it? Is that person still around, and can I ask this to him/her. What do these guys know that I don’t? What is the problem that that this feature solves? Most of the times, you will be surprised by the answer. Develop Humility This is not a difficult task. In all likelihood, you still have huge amounts to learn no matter where you might put yourself on the ladder. Adopting a growth mindset is what allowed me to put myself in the right state of mind. It liberated me to ask questions without the fear of looking stupid. When you know that you are not supposed to know all the answers, but learn all the answers, asking questions becomes just a triviality. It is very easy to think your way of writing code is best, and everyone else’s sucks. Ask three people on how they would split a string into an array of characters, and all would give three different ways of doing it. Probably, all of them are equally good, and something can be learned from all of them. As to dealing with the bad quality code, throwing it away is definitely not the solution. The more business-friendly way would be to start eating the elephant one bite at a time and refactor your way through the code.",Harshdeep Gupta,https://medium.com/@harshdeepgupta?source=post_page---byline--750586ac9a44---------------------------------------,2390,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*5i2TRIvY7KPnUvemtukdwA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EssI64J8Hx2PvShRHukNbA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EssI64J8Hx2PvShRHukNbA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EssI64J8Hx2PvShRHukNbA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5i2TRIvY7KPnUvemtukdwA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5i2TRIvY7KPnUvemtukdwA.jpeg,2019-01-02T22:52:56.606Z,Medium

You’ve got an amazing idea, you’ve done your research, you’ve talked to friends, and you’ve found the passion. What’s next? Well, regardless of how successful you and your startup will be 12 months from now, one thing is for sure, it will be a great learning experience. This reminds me of what my manager at Google once said to me: “Every time someone tells me it was a great learning experience, I had lost time or money.” “Every time someone tells me it was a great learning experience, I had lost time or money.” This post contains a few lessons I learned in the first year of launching my startup, and I hope that by reading and understanding these lessons, I can save you time, or money, or hopefully both. Companies are people. The best people, together, make a great company. The most important decision you’ll make is finding a great co-founder. Until you have one, you don’t have a company. Finding a great co-founder is like finding a best-friend who is very different from you. To find one, you can’t go around asking people to be your best-friend; you’ll need time to pass and experiences to go through together to meet someone like that. Right before I left my job to startEmploy, my manager told me: “Find someone who is not you…and someone who can do what you can’t do.” “Find someone who is not you…and someone who can do what you can’t do.”",Sherjan Husainie,https://unsplash.com/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral,2017,13 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*TFZ-4b559yTZxIbWaecjuw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*TFZ-4b559yTZxIbWaecjuw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*TFZ-4b559yTZxIbWaecjuw.jpeg,2019-01-02T02:05:49.119Z,Medium
https://itnext.io/load-testing-using-apache-jmeter-af189dd6f805?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,Load Testing Using Apache JMeter,Published inITNEXT,"Mitesh Follow ITNEXT -- 1 Listen Share Load testing is the process of putting the load through (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket etc) calls on any software system to determine its behavior under normal and high load conditions. Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes. When we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior, we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system, understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications. We can useApache JMeterfor load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java, so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As perJMeter website, it is defined as mentioned below : The Apache JMeter™ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions. The Apache JMeter™ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions. InstallJMeteron your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter. We first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor, so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests. To start our load test, we need to start with thread groups. They are the beginning point of any test plan. We can specify the number of users (= number of threads) that we want to simulate concurrently. Set ramp-up time which specifies the amount of time it takes to start all threads. We need to define a number of iterations for each user(thread) in the group. Each thread executes the plan independently from other threads. All elements inside single thread will execute sequentially. We can add samplers and logic controllers in a thread group. Samplers help send a request to a server and wait for response i.e. HTTP request sampler to send HTTP request and get the response. Logic controllers help customize the logic to decide when to send a request, modify request etc. Listeners are another type of element which we can add in a thread group. They provide access to information about our load test. Graph result listener helps plot results of our test. View result tree listener shows the detail of request and response. We can add pre-processor and post-processor to a sampler request. Pre-processor executes defined action before sample request and post-processor executes defined action after sample request. Pre-processor can be used to generate dynamic parameters different for each request and post-processor to fetch response parameters to be used by other requests. Config elements are used to configure default value for the samplers. Let’s take a real world example where we are going to create a JMeter test plan with a thread group which can run CRUD operations on user resource at a given server. Each “create user” operation needs to have different email address randomly generated before sending the request. Fetch authentication token and user id provided a response to create user request. An authentication token is used as the header in all subsequent requests and user id in URL and body parameter as needed. Finally, have a view result tree listener where we can see all requests with their responses. Step 1: Add a Thread Group to our test plan Step 2: Add an HTTP request defaults using the config elements to define default parameters like hostname and port of server needed for all requests. Step 3: Add an HTTP request sampler to send create user request. Add body to create an HTTP request with a dynamic email parameter which is generated by pre-processor. Step 4: Add a BeanShell pre-processor to generate a random email address for creating user request. Using java code to generate a random number which is used in new email generation for each request. Step 5: Add a JSON extractor post-processor to get authentication token and userId from the response of creating user request. Reading token from JSON response using JSON extractor. Step 6: Add an HTTP header manager to add authentication token as the header to all subsequent requests. Step 7: Add update user, get user and delete user HTTP request sampler for subsequent requests in the same way as creating user HTTP request sampler with userId as dynamic variable fetched from creating user post-processor. Step 8: Add View result tree to get the response to all requests. Finally, we have our user CRUD load test ready which can be used to generate load by increasing the number of users with ramp-up time. This way we can generate different load test plans to know the limits of our applications.

I work completely online now. I am constantly on my computer or my phone for work. I love that I can work as easily from my couch as in a library as an airport. Sometimes I still want a job that I get paid to do away from the computer, but the mobility for my international life really helps. I also have family and friends across the world, and the only way to talk to them is if I have some screen handy. I love that I can be there for friends and get news from home quickly. I love having my Mum or brother at the other end of the phone in a second — as easy as it is if we lived in the same neighborhood. The problem is everything in between, when twenty minutes after I picked up my phone to look up something, I’m watching kids getting surprised by puppies and whoever Ellen just had on her show. That is on the good days of distraction. We all get addicted to scrolling through random posts, but this year, I want to read more. I want to write more. I want to spend more time thinking instead of being told what to think. I already deleted Snapchat because I couldn’t handle it all. Just recently I was waiting at the Doctor’s office and of course, was scrolling through emails and Instagram. I had a flashback to what waiting rooms were like before smartphones. It was lucky if there were a pile of magazines in the corner. There weremanymoments spent sitting and looking at walls. In the car, if I forgot my book, I was subject to whatever music was on the radio and whatever was interesting outside the window. Thankfully, Ireallyliked books, so most of the time I was happy with waiting wherever. I just know there were many times that humans used to be forced to think for themselves and now, those moments seem to be much less frequent. I’m starting with taking the advice from many articles and taking my phone away from my bedside. Still on ring, if there’s an emergency, it’ll be in my office. My bedside table will hopefully fill up with books and notebooks instead. When I was younger, I used to fall asleep with a book and wake up to read a bit before going downstairs and starting the day. It’s something that I think 2019 will welcome — plus I like coffee now so it’s an adult version. No Instagram allowed.

https://medium.com/geoprotocol/means-of-exchange-in-decentralized-credit-networks-e16f69aec307?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,Means of Exchange in Decentralized Credit Network,Preface,"Max Demyan Follow GEO Protocol -- Listen Share Preface There are currently many means of exchange in national monetary systems. The monetary base includes central bank notes and bank accounts; commercial banks accounts denominated in both national and foreign currencies; and foreign currency in the form of bank notes. In addition to these traditional means of exchange, at the end of the 20th century, e-money that could be emitted by non-bank financial institutions began to grow in popularity and adoption. Complimentary local currencies based on credit as a means of exchange also became increasingly popular. In the 21st century, the range of exchange instruments expanded due to virtual currencies including cryptocurrencies. The emergence and expansion of these new private means of exchange raise questions for regulatory authorities as to the best way of regulating their emission and circulation. Choosing an adequate model of regulation demands a full examination of their economic properties and attributes. One of these new means of money circulation that is yet to receive an official interpretation is decentralized credit networks, which allow for the exchange of goods without a bank acting as an intermediary. The credit network model has the form of a weighted graph, where the value of the graph corresponds to economic agents, and the value of the graph’s edges represents the amount of credit an agent is willing to give to their counterparty. In a centralized credit network, there is only ever one participant to whom all other participants directly provide a loan. In this model, the provision of credit by ordinary network participants to each other is only made possible through the mediation of a person or institution who is at the center of the network. A decentralized credit network is characterized by the fact that there is no center with which all other participants of the network are connected by direct credit relations. There is no single actor in the decentralized credit network that exclusively holds and processes the database which contains the transaction history between network participants. Instead, the distributed database is stored and processed by all members of the network. Figure 1. Direct credit relations in centralized and decentralized credit networks If the model of a centralized credit network is described by a star graph, then the graph of a decentralized credit network has neither restriction on the number of vertices with valence greater than one, nor on the valence of these vertices. P. Dandekar, A. Goel, R. Govindan, and I. Post studied a model of the decentralized credit network in which nodes exchange goods. This is performed not with the help of a common currency, but through commodity credit instruments that are emitted under bilateral credit lines, with the right of use assigned according to the principle of transitivity of trust.. In this model, according to the authors of the aforementioned study, network nodes, “… act like banks and print their own currency, and trust each other for a certain amount of each other’s currency”. They regard such a system as an alternative to the modern banking system, since the latter, “… is a centralized currency infrastructure”, where the central bank is the sole issuer of the currency, and other nodes trust it for a theoretically unlimited amount of this currency. Private means of exchange as emitted by participants of the decentralized credit network do not have the status of a legal payment method. They are accepted only by those who directly opened the credit line to the issuer, and only for the amount of the credit line. The national currency emitted by the central bank, as a legal payment method, must accept all subjects of the national market as the payment method, regardless of the degree of confidence in its issuer. However, a look at the modern banking system as a credit network, in which only the central bank issues the means of exchange, does not fully correspond with reality. As Bank of England researchers, M. McLay, A. Radia and R. Thomas emphasize, in the modern banking system, most of the money is created not by the central bank, but by commercial banks, and not by “multiplying” the money of the central bank, but by issuing loans. Under normal conditions, the central bank does not limit the amount of money generated by commercial banks. It is limited by the ability to compete for commercial banks to profit from loans in which they create money, as well as through prudential regulation that ensures the stability of the financial system. In the modern two-tier banking system, there is a combination of two mechanisms for the emission of two types of money: commercial banks carry out a competitive issue of private monetary obligations repaid by national currency, while the national currency is issued exclusively by the central bank. The analysis of the decentralized credit network as an alternative to the modern monetary system and as an analogue of the modern banking system suggests one possible clue as to the debt obligations of the participants in this network exchange of goods. This question has not yet become the subject of a special study. The first implementation of the decentralized credit network was the Ripple system. Initially, Ripple was positioned as a platform for P2P money transfers, as an alternative to bank transfers, but today it specializes in servicing banks and other financial institutions. The second such network was Stellar, which is also positioned as a decentralized money transfer system, but, in contrast to Ripple, not between financial institutions, but directly between individuals. The authors of the SilentWhispers decentralized credit network project argue that systems such as Ripple, “… allow for multi-currency transactions (in fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and user currencies) …”. This statement, however, requires clarification. The only means of exchange that can be transferred within the framework of a decentralized credit network is the debt obligations of its participants. These debt obligations can be denominated in any commodity or currency, including those in the mentioned assets, but they are not identical to these assets. The recipient of such a debt obligation, nominated in cryptocurrency, for example, can repay it from the issuer (or in any other way) and receive cryptocurrency. However, this does not give grounds to assert that the transaction in the credit network was performed through cryptocurrency. In contrast to the projects mentioned above, the GEO Protocol project is positioned not only as a money transfer system but also as a decentralized credit network, allowing for an exchange of goods without traditional means of exchange. In the documentation of this project, the economic content of debt obligations that network participants use for exchanging goods is not analyzed. The authors of the GEO Protocol are limited to the understanding that in this network the means of exchange are debt obligations. Means of exchange in decentralized credit networks are by nature debt obligations, but the content of these obligations and their differences from traditional means of exchange is not the subject of this study. The existing implementations of such networks focus on remittances, therefore, the debt obligations in them represent monetary obligations and their content is no different from traditional electronic money. In studies of decentralized credit networks, where the debt obligations of network participants are considered a means of exchanging goods, rather than as a means of remittances, the analysis of the economic content of these debt obligations is not a part of the research objectives. The objective of this article is to analyze the economic content of debt obligations that function as a means of exchanging goods within a decentralized credit network, as well as a comparative analysis of these obligations and such traditional means of exchange such as national fiat money, entries in commercial bank accounts, and e-money. The simplest exchange of goods between participants of a decentralized credit network takes place within the framework of direct credit relations between two participants. Figure 2. The exchange of goods between the participants of the decentralized credit network (direct credit relations) Seller B credits buyer A for a certain amount calculated in a given equivalent. Buyer-borrower A has the opportunity to purchase goods on credit for this amount. The instrument of this loan is the debt obligations of participant A, which they provide to participant B in exchange for goods. In turn, the seller-creditor B, who received the debt obligations of buyer-borrower A in exchange for their goods, may subsequently repay these obligations with goods offered by the debtor in the market. A more complex scheme for the exchange of goods between participants in a decentralized credit network occurs when there is no direct credit relationship between the buyer-borrower and the seller-creditor. If there is no direct credit relationship between participants A and B, then A will not be able to purchase goods from B on credit in exchange for their debt obligations, and B, respectively, will not be able to purchase goods from A. Purchase by the buyer A of goods on credit from the seller B becomes possible if there is a participant C who has direct credit relations with both A and B. Figure 3. The exchange of goods between participants of the decentralized credit network (mediated credit relations) First, buyer A exchanges their debt obligations for the debt obligations of participant C. This allows A to purchase goods on credit from B in exchange for the debt obligations of C. In other words, buyer A transfers to seller B the debt obligations of participant C in exchange for the goods of B. The repayment of a commodity credit that has arisen, takes place by means of a reverse assignment of debt obligations of C: participant B transfers them to participant A in exchange for their goods, after which A exchanges them from participant C for their own debt obligations. Figure 3shows the simplest scheme of mediated credit relations between participants in a decentralized credit network. This scheme becomes more complicated when participant C has no direct credit connection with seller B, but at the same time, for example, can get a loan from participant D, with whom seller B has a direct credit relationship. Then, between buyer A and seller B, there will be not one, but two intermediate links: C and D. In theory, the number of such intermediate links in the chain of mediated credit connection is limited only by the number of network participants, and the number of direct credit links between them. In some decentralized credit networks, under certain conditions, the assignment of participants’ debts on the basis of the principle of transitivity of trust provides liquidity comparable to a centralized credit network.. Consequently, exchanging goods through their debt obligations, the participants of the decentralized credit network enter into a commodity loan relationship: the object of the loan, like the means of repaying it, is not money, but goods. At the same time, the loan amount is calculated not in goods, but in some equivalent, since the prices of all goods in the market are nominated in some equivalent. Debt obligations emitted and repaid by participants of a decentralized credit network in the process of exchanging goods are, by their economic content, bonds or, in other words, vouchers. A voucher is an issuer’s obligation to provide some goods for a fixed amount of some equivalent sum. The issuer of such vouchers can be not only a cellular operator or a supermarket, but any seller of any goods. Vouchers that are used to exchange goods only within the framework of direct credit relations between the buyer-borrower and the seller-creditor serve the exchange of goods only between these two participants. Vouchers that are assigned to third parties in exchange for their goods can be used as a means of exchange for the numerous network participants. What is the difference between vouchers emitted by participants of a decentralized credit network, from traditional means of exchange such as the national currencies and private credit money, which is issued by commercial banks and other financial institutions? How different are the schemes for exchanging goods using these contrasting means of exchange? National fiat money Modern national currencies represent the debt obligations of the central bank — their issue is reflected in the liabilities of the central bank. However, the generic feature of this type of money cannot be that it is emitted by a central bank since state fiat money existed long before the emergence of central banks. Central banks are not a necessary condition for the issue, circulation and repayment of money in this type of exchange. The reason for the emergence of state fiat money is the need to finance government spending. The government issues its own debt obligations, which are nominated either in some equivalent or in themselves, as in the case of modern national currencies. In exchange for these obligations, the government purchases goods, including labour. The government does not undertake to repay its obligations with a fixed quantity of any product or money. The only way to pay off these obligations is to use them as legal tender: the holder of these obligations can make any official payment by them. First of all, such payments are taxes and fees paid to the state treasury, but the range of goods that can be used to repay state fiat money from their issuer is not necessarily limited to this. Figure 4. Exchange of goods through national fiat money. In the case when there is no direct credit connection between buyer A and seller B, A may receive national fiat money from government C in exchange for their goods. Now A may receive goods from B by assigning them the debt obligations received from C. Further, participant B may, in turn, receive the goods from participant A by assigning them the obligations of C, after which A repays these obligations from their issuer. The issuer can accept its obligations as an official payment, for example, as a means of repaying participant A’s tax obligations or simply exchange them for goods offered on the market. According to its economic content, the scheme of exchanging goods by means of national fiat money is similar to the scheme of exchanging goods between participants of a decentralized credit network who do not have a direct credit connection: buyer A assigns to seller B the obligations of a third party. At the same time, technically, the operation of assigning the obligations of the third party may differ significantly. Buyer A assigns national fiat money directly to seller B — this transaction is carried out without the participation and without the knowledge of the issuer of this money. Circulation of national fiat money occurs in a decentralized manner, as bilateral transactions between sellers and buyers. The participation of the issuer of these means of exchange or any other central authority in these transactions as an intermediary is not necessary. The assignment of a voucher that is being circulated offline in the form of a certain material carrier, for example, a paper voucher, does not require the participation of its issuer. The assignment of a voucher that exists as a record in a database, saved by participants of a decentralized online credit network, cannot take place without the participation of its issuer. The issuer of such a voucher always participates as an intermediary in transactions with their voucher. The scheme of using a third party voucher to obtain a commodity credit in a decentralized credit network operates online as follows: Figure 5. Exchange of goods between participants of a decentralized online credit network (mediated credit relations): technical aspect. Buyer-borrower A does not receive the obligations of participant C, which they then transfer to seller-creditor B in exchange for their goods. Buyer A only transfers to the participant C their obligations, and the transfer of such to the seller B participant C carry out their self. A and B do not exchange the obligations by C directly — participant C carries out transactions with these vouchers. In contrast to the system of national fiat money, a decentralized online credit network does not carry out a direct transfer of obligations of a third party without the participation and the knowledge of this party. This feature of a decentralized credit network is compensated by the fact that network members are free to establish direct credit relations. In the system of national fiat money, direct credit relations are possible only with one participant — the issuer of fiat money. The emission of vouchers in a decentralized credit network, as well as the emission of national fiat money, is carried out in a centralized manner; the network participant exclusively issues their debt obligations. The possibility of a free establishment of direct credit relations between sellers and buyers is what gives rise to the fundamental difference in the mechanism for issuing means of exchange in a decentralized credit network. Importantly, the number of people who can issue a means of exchange is greater than one — each network participant has this ability. Records on commercial banks accounts Modern commercial banks issue private credit money in the form of records on the accounts of their clients. The record on the client’s current account reflects the bank’s obligation to this client to provide them with the national currency on demand for the amount fixed in the record. The credit money of commercial banks is denominated in national currency and is repaid by it. Figure 6. The exchange of goods through records on a commercial bank account. The emission of bank credit money occurs in exchange for the obligations of the borrower. According to the turnover so often cited in textbooks on the theory of money, banks, “mint money from private obligations, converting them into generally accepted ones”. Buyer-borrower A exchanges from the bank C its obligations for the obligations of this bank. Obligations received from the bank, A transfers to the creditor-seller B in exchange for their goods. B can then purchase goods from A by assigning them obligations of C, which A can exchange from C for their obligations, i.e. pay off their debt to the bank. Technically, the assignment of liabilities of a commercial bank is similar to the assignment of vouchers in a decentralized credit network operating online, as shown in Figure 5. Buyer A does not directly assign to seller B the obligations of participant C. A commercial bank is an intermediary in all transactions with its monetary obligations; without the bank’s participation, the assignment of its financial obligations cannot take place. In this system of goods exchange, there is no possibility of establishing direct credit relations between sellers and buyers. Whereas in the system of national fiat money the right to establish direct credit relations is exclusively owned by the government, in the banking system direct credit relations are possible only with banks. The scheme of centralized emission of credit money by the bank, shown in Figure 6, is not exclusive to the activities of commercial banks. Modern national currencies aren’t emitted directly by governments — the emission of national fiat money in pure form is not practised. Today, the national currency is used in the form of banknotes by central banks, as well as records in central bank accounts. These means of exchange, like the liabilities of commercial banks, are issued in exchange for debt obligations. Emission of bank money may occur in exchange for either private or government debt obligations. Banknotes of a modern central bank, like classic banknotes or national fiat money, can be assigned without the participation of their issuer. The records on the accounts at the central bank, as well as the records on the accounts at the commercial bank, cannot circulate without the participation of their issuer — the bank always acts as an intermediary in transactions with their debt obligations. E-money E-money is “… the monetary value represented by the requirement to the issuer, which: i) is stored on an electronic device; ii) is emitted after receipt of funds in the amount of not less than the emitted monetary value; iii) is accepted as a means of payment not only by the issuer but also by other firms”. E-money is a monetary obligation, similar to the records on accounts in commercial banks: the issuer undertakes to repay its obligations with a fixed amount of a predetermined national currency. Electronic money nominated and repaid not by national currency, but by noble metals, is much less common practice. If in the EU e-money issuers can be non-bank financial institutions, then in Ukraine, for example, only commercial banks can issue such means of exchange. If in the EU e-money can be considered as an alternative to private bank money, in Ukraine, e-money is only a banking product. The schemes for exchanging goods using e-money and using records on accounts in a commercial bank appear interchangeable, as long as the bank does not “mint” its obligations from private obligations, but issues them in exchange for money. Figure 7. Exchange of goods through e-money. Buyer A exchanges money for the repayment obligations of participant C. Buyer A assigns to creditor B obtained obligations of participant C. In this scheme, unlike the scheme in Figure 6, A does not receive a loan from C because they acquire obligations from C, not in exchange for their own commitment, but in exchange for money. B then exchanges goods for the obligations of C from A after which A repays obligations by C to their issuer with a fixed amount of money or some commodity, for example, a noble metal. Similar to the scheme of exchanging goods using records on accounts in a commercial bank, buyer A does not directly assign to seller B the obligations of C. Participant C is an intermediary in all transactions with their obligations and there is no possibility of establishing direct credit relations between the buyer and seller. A special type of e-money is e-cash. In contrast to the e-money system discussed above, in which monetary obligations exist in the form of records on accounts at the issuing institution, the tangible carrier of e-cash is at the disposal of the holder, not the issuer. E-cash is a modern analogue of classic banknotes; these are centrally emitted private financial obligations that can circulate without the participation of their issuer. The buyer can make an offline payment, assigning the e-cash to the seller directly. The assignment of these obligations is technically carried out by direct transfer from the buyer’s device to the seller’s device. In this respect, e-cash is not only similar to a classic banknote, but also to paper private vouchers and national fiat money — all these means of exchange allow for P2P-transactions. Debt obligations of participants of a decentralized credit network which are used to exchange goods without the mediation of banks are private vouchers. These vouchers are repaid in goods, not in money, and the quantity of goods to which they will be repaid is not fixed in advance: vouchers are nominated in an equivalent other than the goods in which they will be repaid. Means of exchange in a decentralized credit network have both common features and differences to traditional means of exchange. The common feature present in all the considered means of exchange is a centralized emission. According to such criteria as the emission channel; the means of repayment and its amount; the need for the issuer’s participation in circulation; and the need for commercial banks to participate in the system, private vouchers are not identical either to national fiat money, to records on commercial bank accounts, or e-money. A private voucher has similarities with national fiat money, with private bank money, and with e-money. Like bank money, vouchers are issued for debt obligations. National fiat money is repaid with goods as well as vouchers, the amount of which isn’t fixed in advance. Vouchers, like e-money, are not homogeneous in terms of the issuer’s participation in their circulation: there are those that can only circulate with the mediation of the issuer, and those that can circulate without it. The principal difference between the exchange of goods through private vouchers and the traditional exchange systems mentioned above is that sellers and buyers have the freedom to establish direct credit relations. In the system of national fiat money, direct credit relations between the seller and the buyer arise only when selling goods to the issuer of fiat money. There are no direct credit relations between the seller and the buyer in the systems of bank money and e-money: sellers and buyers enter into credit relations only through an intermediary, in the form of a bank or a non-bank financial institution. In the system of private vouchers, sellers and buyers can freely establish direct credit links and the number of these links is limited only by the number of network participants. The purpose of this study was to analyze the content of debt obligations of participants in a decentralized credit network issued for the exchange of goods without the mediation of banks, as well as comparing these obligations with national fiat money, and records on accounts in commercial banks and e-money. The question of whether private vouchers are substitutes for traditional means of exchange, a true substitute or alternative, deserves further research. Bank for International Settlements.

The NumPy Base N-dimensional array package usually contains: a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities Alibaba Cloud recently announced that it has open sourced Mars — its tensor-based framework for large-scale data computation — on Github.Mars can be regarded as “a parallel and distributed NumPy.” Mars can tile a large tensor into small chunks and describe the inner computation with a directed graph, enabling the running of parallel computation on a wide range of distributed environments, from a single machine to a cluster comprising thousands of machines. Alibaba Cloud Senior Engineer Xuye Qin introduced Mars from a performance perspective, boasting that “Mars can complete the computation on a 2.25T-size matrix and a 2.25T-size matrix multiplication in two hours.” Mars’ key advantage is its ability to run matrix computation at a very large-scale, a forte that NumPy does not share. The chart below illustrates a simple experiment Alibaba developers ran to test Mars’ performance: They added one and then multiplied the result ((X+1)*2) for 3.6 billion data, then tested the change in computing time as the workers number (number of machines) increased. NumPy, represented by the red cross in the upper left, lags far behind Mars tensors, whose performance approaches ideal values. Mars currently supports a subset of NumPy interfaces, including: Arithmetic and mathematics:+,-,*,/,exp,log, etc. Reduction along axes (sum,max,argmax, etc). Most of thearray creation routines(empty,ones_like,diag, etc). What’s more, Mars not only supports create array/tensor on GPU, but also supports create sparse tensor. Most of thearray manipulation routines(reshape,rollaxis,concatenate, etc.) Basic indexing(indexing by ints, slices, newaxes, and Ellipsis) Fancy indexing along single axis with lists or numpy arrays, e.g. x[[1, 4, 8], :5] universal functionsfor elementwise operations. Linear algebra functions, including product (dot,matmul, etc.) and decomposition (cholesky,svd, etc.). Mars tensor provides a familiar interface much like NumPy. Mars tensor can be installed with the code below: Mars in distributed version is now available on Linux and Mac OS. Clickthis linkfor the Mars Github page.

Each stand-alone episode paints a picture of a world that’s futuristic, yet believable; sleek, yet horrifying. Each of thesestudy guideswill examine the themes of a particular episode. All screencaps are mine. When we first got word that 2018’s entry ofBlack Mirrorwould be “interactive” and a choose-your-own-adventure-style story, I laughed.Black Mirror, with the exception of episodes like “San Junipero”and “Hang the DJ,” is a very pessimistic show. So an episode said to allow you to make choices would undoubtedly be about the illusion of choice, free will, and control. WithBandersnatchnow released, that remains true. Choices and Consequences Right off the bat, the first choice you’re presented with is between two breakfast cereals for Stefan. The second is a choice regarding what music Stefan listens to on the bus to Tuckersoft. They’re obviously small choices, serving more as a tutorial for the rest of the episode, a proof of concept that shows your choices will have material effect. Stefan’s fate is in your hands; you can determine how the story unfolds and ends.",Howard Chai,https://medium.com/@howard24/black-mirror-study-guide-hang-the-dj-1aa96d4ee343,2711,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*116FBaOzxGlXIma5hKkVEQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*116FBaOzxGlXIma5hKkVEQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*116FBaOzxGlXIma5hKkVEQ.jpeg,2020-10-15T00:32:28.522Z,Medium
https://medium.com/communityworksjournal/are-our-educators-prepared-for-their-students-79391715b633?source=tag_archive---------163-----------------------,Are Our Educators Prepared For Their Students?,Published inCommunity Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators,"Joe Brooks Follow Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators -- Listen Share By TOM WHITBY If there is one thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that rapid change greatly affects both what and how we learn. If there is a second thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that the evolution of technology is the driver of rapid change throughout our culture. Both of these factors in education and our culture lead me to question if teachers are being properly prepared to teach students whose learning is affected by so many different influences? The past learning experiences of educators are so different from the current and evolving experiences of their students that relevance as an educator is extremely important. Do today’s teachers understand the learning needs of today’s students? A generational gap is a world of difference in terms of technology. For this reason I feel that many educators are products of a 20th century education that limits them as educators in the 21st century. Of course there are educators who have continually, professionally developed to stay relevant, but maybe not in enough numbers to make a great difference. In the 20th century information was for the most part slower to change and often controlled by a small group of power brokers. News came from newspapers and magazines that were limited to publishing cycles and editors. The media was dominated by three networks which were limited by news cycles and strict editorial boards. Censors were assigned to every entertainment show to regulate the perceived moral agenda. Encyclopedias took years to amend and edit with an additional year to physically publish and were limited in circulation by high costs to the general public. Most households had telephones, but not a private line for each household member. The challenges of rapid change were not yet in place even though the stage was being set. The Vietnam War began to awaken changes in the way we viewed the news. Journalists used more media tools in their reporting. Photos and film began to be broadcast in the news cycle, which was at a family-gathered dinnertime for most Americans. Students were moved by what they saw and many began to demonstrate against the government in numbers never before seen. These demonstrations then became media news as well, which exacerbated the anti-war movement. It took years of this to bring the war to an end, even with the help of the existing technology, which was controlled by forces heavily influenced by the government. This was the way it was until the introduction of cable for more choice in entertainment and 24 hour news reporting. Gaming came along with Pong and later Donkey Kong, followed by The Oregon Trail. Calculators became portable and electronic. Life was good and teaching was pretty much focused on lecture and direct instruction because that was how it was always done. It worked because that was all we knew. The teacher stood in the front and students sat in rows. The Internet was about to take a wrecking ball to that whole mindset prevalent in that century in that world. Now we arrive in the 21st century with all of its technological advances. The Internet provides access to most of information ever to be established in the world. It provides access to entertainment that is often uncensored and unfiltered. Smartphones, which are not really phones, but powerful computers with phone capabilities. People have 24-hour connectivity to any person or source for the purpose of collaboration, curation, or simple communication. Computer-generated games that are realistic and intelligent, that may be played collaboratively and simultaneously with people around the world. What does all of this have to do with our students today is the question that we need to address. Students today have grown up after all of these changes have taken place. Their world is different than many of their educators. It is also continuing to evolve even at a faster pace than ever before experienced and it will continue that way into the future. Today’s students have grown up immersed in technology. They have had access to computers their entire lives. Their smartphones have more power than the computers that were used to put a man on the moon. Students are entertained by shows that they can select from literally hundreds of choices, most uncensored. Their news exposure is 24 hours a day from many sources. They can follow blogs that speak to their interests. They have mastered social media. They are comfortable collaborating with others. They are comfortable creating their own information in the form of text, music, audio, or video. The most important part of this is that their computer is their publisher. They need no adult permission to publish whatever they want to a waiting world on the Internet. They accept failure in games as a challenge to overcome in order to win. They can access any information at anytime to question any facts adults may throw at them. The most important point here is that they can also learn in spite of an irrelevant educator. Information once controlled by academia is now free and easily accessed. Educators should view these technology skills as assets to be supported and enhanced. Critical thinking should be a key to accessing the valid and valued information needed. Collaborative learning should be the focus before lecture and direct instruction. Students who have great choices in their everyday lives should have more of a say in their own learning. Student voice is essential for students to own their learning. Mentoring students in using their technology skills to curate, communicate, and create content is a more effective way to learn than to simply consume teacher-selected content. Educators need to understand that they are teaching kids to live in a world that is not yet here. We are not slow to change any longer. Developing students who are flexible and willing to continually learn is the best we can do to insure their future. Teaching kids how to learn is more important than to teach them what to learn. They will find on their own what it is that they personally need to learn. Preparation for that point in time is what we need to teach them. As I watch these students from Parkland, Florida, I am more convinced that this is the way we must teach. These kids are not “Actors” as some suggest. They are articulate, intelligent, technology savvy students who have a need to learn, create, collaborate, and communicate. They do it so well; it causes 20th century thinkers to question their validity. They are real, and now have a cause and a purpose with the skills to present it to their country. I am not saying that all teachers are not doing their best to teach. I believe that most are doing their very best. I also believe that in a world where change is so rapid, the tools that educators have been prepared with may no longer serve that purpose. We need to continually train educators more than one or two days in a year. Irrelevant teachers are the fault of the districts in which they work. If we are to better educate our kids, we must first better educate their educators.

We also want those movies to play at a steady24 fps(or higher) without tearing or jumpiness. With that said, what if we were to slow those movies down, way down to say, like 24 fph (frames per hour)? That’s the idea behind Bryon Boyer’sVery Slow Movie Player(VSMP), which will play a roughly two-hour movie on an ePaper display over the course of about 8,000 hours or approximately a year. On the technical side, Bryon’s VSMP features a Pervasive Displays’ 7.4-inch ePaper display (480 x 800- 126dpi), which is connected to aRaspberry Pi Zerorunning a Python script that converts a frame from a movie file into a black and white dithered file and then sends it to the screen. The whole setup is packed into a creative 3D-printed case that can be positioned or hung like any digital photo display. Bryon came up with the VSMP idea while walking around Brasilia and studying the city’s beautiful architecture and noted that the city was “designed to be “read” at the speed of a vehicle, so taking in Brasília by foot is like watching a movie in slow motion.” He then pondered: “Can a film be consumed at the speed of reading a book? Yes, just as a car city can be enjoyed on foot. Slowing things down to an extreme measure creates room for appreciation of the object, as in Brasília, but the prolonged duration also starts to shift the relationship between object, viewer, and context. A film watched at 1/3,600th of the original speed is not a very slow movie, it’s a hazy timepiece. A Very Slow Movie Player (VSMP) doesn’t tell you the time; it helps you see yourself against the smear of time.” “Can a film be consumed at the speed of reading a book?

https://medium.com/@easytimetracking/11-ways-social-media-will-evolve-in-the-future-f6a3b747c4b0?source=tag_archive---------164-----------------------,11 ways social media will evolve in the future.,Written byDaniel Bernard,"Daniel Bernard Follow -- Listen Share Social media is growing at a rapid rate. As more and more people find new ways to contribute to social media, it will continue to unfold. Social media is an open platform and highly integrable with any other program or algorithms which allows for even more expansion and flexibility to make it even better. With these above ideas in mind, let us explore how social media will change as we progress. 1. Customized platform:With the integration of A.I. into social media, your profile and your social media will get customized according to your habits, behaviors, and personal preferences. You will be able to book cabs, order food and check your feed all in one platform. To be more succinct, social media will be an all-in-one app or platform for your daily needs and tasks. 2. Richness in quality of posts:The quality of social media posts will be rich in content and variety. As of now, you can see high-quality photos on Instagram. This will transcend all platforms. On top of that, the new IGTV feature in Instagram is gaining a ton of traction which will eventually convert to a mini YouTube sort of thing (already happening). These examples suggest a pattern or hint towards what we can expect in the future. 3. Videos:The Internet is more accessible now than ever. Facebook recently announced that it would focus more on delivering videos to your news feed and suggested that videos were the future in social media. If you are a frequent user of Facebook, you may have already noticed this trend. Facebook is going to add more videos to your newsfeed. 4. Customizable:Social media platforms will adhere to your preferences, tastes, and needs. This means that you will be able to select the themes and layout, customize the tabs, and design the layout you want from a selection of combinations. 5. Mobile-friendly:If you head over to the Instagram website on your PC and login, you will notice that it doesn’t allow for messages and has limited features. Instagram is totally mobile-based and this is what the social media giants and new social media platforms will come up with in the future. They will focus entirely on mobile. 6. Experimental:Social media will undergo a ton of experiments. These experiments will make the user experience much better. These may include the use of Virtual reality, 3D images or videos, Artificial Intelligence etc. 7. Integration:Since social media already has a lot of data (contacts, numbers, people information etc.), it is effortless to add a payment app or integrate with payment gateway or other similar features making social media friendlier and easier to use. However, privacy is a concern which brings us to the next point. 8. Privacy:Social media companies are taking privacy more seriously now more than over. Since, they have accumulated a lot of contact details, personal details etc. they bear a public responsibility to protect and secure the data. Data in the wrong hands can be misused and the consequences can be severe. 9. Sharing of data:This point is subtle but powerful. With the help of your social media usage, companies gather small data over time, and these will help other companies like e-commerce or any ad companies to understand your likes, preferences and spending habits. This will allow the companies to advertise the product you want and make sure that you see it. This will result in effective advertising. This is highly beneficial to companies. You may argue that this is already in process, however, it is also worthy to note that this feature will enhance and get more accurate. 10. Community building:To an extent, small communities will stop building websites and instead use social media as their main source of communication both internally and externally. With bots, communities will be able to get in touch and answer customers’ queries easily and effortlessly. This will encourage more communities in the long-run. 11. More Real:Though we are coming across thousands of photo-shopped Instagram images, we are also learning that expressing authenticity is equally important. This awareness has already been initiated and slowly getting popular. On a broader perspective, these are the 11 ways social media will evolve and make our lives and business better. If you have any more points, do let us know.

https://medium.com/hodl-finance/alternatives-to-blockchain-lightning-network-for-dummies-9cf085196742?source=tag_archive---------77-----------------------,Alternatives to Blockchain? Lightning Network for Dummies,Published inHODL Finance,"Hodl Finance Follow HODL Finance -- Listen Share Gintautas Scerbavicius The initial popularity of blockchain technology was fueled by its decentralized nature. The traditional way of exchanging currency on-line always includes a third party. A bank is needed to ensure that the transaction is correct and that the sender has the money to send. In a distributed ledger, a central party is not needed at all — double-spend is ensured by the blockchain. Another factor that triggered popularity is the idea of money that is not controlled by any government, but by the people. Blockchain lets us run a public record of transactions which ensures the legitimacy of all transactions and the rules are implemented from the very start through the technology itself and the smart contracts they use. Still, it is not without its limits. The two most popular currencies that use blockchain, Ether and Bitcoin, suffer from the same problem. They lack scalability. Due to the massive popularity of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the number of transactions has skyrocketed and issues have become apparent. The time to complete a transaction went as high as 78 minutes per transaction and the fees went as high as $50. These kinds of limitations are present with many of the cryptocurrencies. Therefore solutions are needed. For Ethereum it is Sharding, for Bitcoin — Lightning Network. The main advantage of using the Lightning Network is the speed and cost of the transaction. Due to the fact that the transactions are conducted outside the chain, the network can group a huge number of microtransactions and then send them into the Bitcoin chain as a single entry. The Lightning Network can essentially cut down the transaction completion time from somewhere around an hour to instantaneous. The Lightning Network can potentially raise the capabilities of Bitcoin to billions of transactions per second which is a huge jump in efficiency. Nothing — it will operate as it used to. It will continue to be reliable, trusted, and distributed. The Bitcoin network will record transactions either coming from Lightning or direct. Due to the fact that direct transactions to the Bitcoin chain are slower (compared to Lightning) and more costly, it will mostly be used for large transfers. In the same way, the aggregated transactions from the Bitcoin Lightning Network will be sent to the main chain as in bulk — one big transaction. HODL Finance is the European digital lending company.

https://medium.com/positiveslope/longer-term-outlook-8-forecasts-for-the-future-a960bc1e09d1?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,Longer-Term Outlook: 8 Forecasts For The Future,(1) Disruptive interfaces will wreak havoc across segments of e-commerce and on-demand services.,"Scott Belsky Follow Positive Slope -- 4 Listen Share Forecasting the future is a fun exercise. I like to ask the question, “what about our work and lives today will feel ridiculous ten plus years from now?” What about the future will feel obvious in retrospect? Future forecasts are not an investment thesis because innovations, no matter how exciting they are, won’t happen until the present is ready for them (and this is why the best investors are more insightful about the present than they are about the future). But if you’re a product leader, entrepreneur, or very early-stage investor, future thinking tunes your attention and instincts. It also helps you determine whether a team is attempting to defy a likely outcome or make it happen in a better way. This year I shared some early thoughts on Twitter and solicited other ideas, which I have incorporated and attributed across the 8 themes below. I have also tried to connect some of my work and investments to these themes, which has been an interesting exercise. Disruptive interfaces will wreak havoc across segments of e-commerce and on-demand services. Local city transit will improve by a step-function as government takes over autonomous transportation. A final death blow to analog ways of living as everyday actions are modernized and go mobile. Efficiencies and environmentally-sound practices go mainstream as lower costs and ease of consumption align with environmental consciousness. A new era of personalization that antiquates generalized products and services. A “great awakening” from what we learn about ourselves that will transform our lives. We’ll want stronger relationships, fewer loose connections. Artificial intelligence will protect us more than we ever expected. Let’s jump in. (1) Disruptive interfaces will wreak havoc across segments of e-commerce and on-demand services. This is a trend I have been following for sometime andrecently wrote about. As modern interfaces like voice remove options, augmented reality overlays our physical world, and artificial intelligence gains our trust by transcending our own reasoning, defaults will rule our lives and interfaces will compete against one another. I’ve come to call themdisruptive interfaces— “drastically simpler and more accessible interfaces that ultimately commoditize everything underneath.” Consider some of the implications as modern interfaces like voice and AR go mainstream: Today, we choose between brands like Uber and Lyft or Energizer and Duracell. But as modern interfaces emerge with powerful defaults, we’ll simply request a ride or refill of batteries and get the (alleged) cheapest and fastest option by default.In such a world, will we look back at the era of so many choices influenced by brand with disbelief? In a world where we’re experiencing our surroundings through the lens of our cameras (or special AR glasses), “in-camera” purchases (offers we receive during augmented reality experiences) will be the new “in-app” purchases.Perhaps we’ll look back 10+ years from now with disbelief that we purchased anything without examining it in 3D? This begs the question of whether hardware providers like Apple and Google will capture a percentage of these purchases? Will we someday look back at the “raw world” before everything was “edited” by AR?Imagine the benefits of augmented reality editing our daily lives to block ads and visibly discourage us from consuming too much sugar or carbs! Will the “raw world” we live in today look antiquated ten years from now? In such a world, will our “phones” simply be mobile battery packs that connect to cellular networks and provide some “local” storage for security and identity purposes only? Other insights:Responding to my thread on Twitter on the topic of AR,Cameron Cundiffnoted how ridiculous it will feel “that we used two-dimensional, mostly visual maps for way-finding, without augmentation with virtual landmarks, tactile feedback, and spatial audio.” I agree. We’ll become dependent on navigating life with an augmented layer of information over every person and place we encounter, and this three-dimensional experience will be animated and interactive in ways we can only imagine. I’ve been pretty focused on the building blocks for this future in my role at Adobe. The AR world will require deep integrations between products for 3D rendering (like Dimension), animation (like After Effects), and new products for editing 3D assets and “placing them in the real world” (likeProject Aero). And voice-driven worlds will require new tools to design voice interfaces, likeAdobeXD(free, check it out!), made possible by our recent acquisition of NYC-based Sayspring. (2) Local city transit will improve by a step-function as government takes over autonomous transportation. I continue to believe that autonomous transportation, at least within city limits, will ultimately become a public utility, much like the subways, running water, and electricity. As transportation data in cities becomes the ultimate asset for scheduling and managing autonomous vehicles, it is much more probable that cities will operate autonomous vehicles and restrict access to main roads than a world where tons of privately owned autonomous vehicles using independent data sets roam the public streets. Of course, many people think that the idea of manual driving will be archaic.My colleagueEd Albrosuggested “Driving cars ourselves, except as recreation” will feel ridiculous in the 10+ year timeframe.Ben Gilbertadded how strange it will be “that we thought autonomous vehicles could be too dangerous.” AndJulia DeWalclearly anticipates an evolution in the design of “streets” as we know them, remarking that we’ll look back in disbelief “that riding a bike or scooter to get around the city was dangerous (manual driving cars, insufficient bike lanes).” If Transportation data becomes a public asset, I can see companies like Remix Software (a company I work with) that focus on bus/vehicle route planning, scheduling, and data management becoming more important players in urban transportation.If autonomous transportation does become more of a public utility, what does this mean for today’s ride-sharing companies like Uber (certainly thriving in the near-term, but will Uber need to build services on top of it’s platform, like UberEats and other services like grocery delivery, to stay differentiated?). (3)A final death blow to analog ways of living as everyday actions are modernized and go mobile. This one goes without saying, but the surprising thing is just how long it has taken for everyday life to be improved through readily accessible technology. In ten years, what about today will we recall with disbelief? “That we plugged in nearly every electronic device around us”—Blaine Sheldon.‏ It is amazing how dependent we are on outlets and wires these days. Will Apple’s AirPower ship in 2019? Rumor is that the delays are due to the unique charging coil designs required to charge different types of products on the same array. “Cables!”—Andrew Allen‏ Let’s hope so, my travel bag makes me feel like a cable salesman these days. “That you needed physical keys to enter homes and exchanged pieces of paper called ‘checks’ as a meta representation of currency”—Antonio Altamirano‏ Well, August (now acquired by Assa Abloy) among many other digital lock companies have allowed us to “go keyless,” now it’s just a matter of mass adoption. Companies like AirBnB could help accelerate this transition. As for “checks,” what a striking remnant of the last century, huh? Personally, I only use mobile deposits at this point and haven’t deposited a check at the bank in years. I am surprised banks haven’t offered a “digital check” service in their apps that essentially acts as a consumer interface for ACH. I’m sure there’s an annoying reason why not. “That you couldn’t vote online.”—jeffrey‏ Amen, my friend. I would imagine the first step here is for a piece of legislation that sets a deadline for a digital voting overhaul. I would love to better understand the obstacles and potential paths. “That IDs where made of fancy cardboard or plastic and that identity confirmation was so broken that personal records were stolen by the millions.”—Antonio Altamirano‏ Identity theft is common these days, and I agree the whole system is broken. I recall a rumor that Apple and Google were both pursuing some form of approval for mobile-hosted government-accepted IDs and Passports. That would be a start. “That we had to type words (letter by letter) actively into a screen rather than speak our thoughts to an AI robot”—Antonio Altamirano‏No doubt, voice interfaces are here to stay.Brian Roemmelehas been one of the earliest vocal visionaries and advocates for voice interfaces. I bet if you ask him, he’ll convince you why we’ll have more interactions with our voice than with our fingers. Even for rather complex applications like Photoshop, the opportunity to engage via voice, coupled with artificial intelligence to further personalize the experience, will change the way we live and work. My Adobe colleagueErik Natzkeanticipates life with “no more hard drives, no more album releases (it will just be song by song), no more check-out counters, and no more time-based TV programming.”I agree with this last point, except when it comes to sports and gameshows. Sitting on the board of Cheddar, a post-cable news network that has developed new formats for news and new methods of distribution, I think “TV” as we know it will be entirely different 5–10 years from now. (4) Efficiencies and environmentally-sound practices go mainstream as lower costs and ease of consumption align with environmental consciousness. The stars are finally aligning for environmentally-sound products, customer preferences, and distribution. As it becomes clear that factory farms are prone to bacterial outbreaks and so many foods and cosmetics contain questionable chemicals, we will crave more “natural” ways of living in every respect. This will change what we buy, the food we eat, and unleash a ton of innovation in the form factor of consumer goods. We’ll find it ridiculous that the meat we ate came from actual live animals.Meat alternatives are becoming more popular, but lab grown meat will change everything. Companies like Memphis Meats (not one of my investments, but I wish it was) are growing meat in the labs that is indistinguishable from a killed animal at a cellular level. Once lab-grown meat becomes both safer, more reliable, cheaper, and perhaps even more delicious (not to mention, more humane), the tide will turn. This will also be important for the environment, given that methane and waste runoff from factory farms are among the greatest contributors to environmental calamities. There will be a boom in local produce from urban farms like Bowery Farms and Square Roots that provide a fresher, more reliable, affordable, and often times tastier harvest(achieved through a fully controlled environmental) than traditional farms that ship product far and wide. A ton of venture capital has already been invested in this space, especially as it relates to the “operating systems” for these modern urban farms to function. There will be a shift towards “shipping concentrates versus ready-to-use bottles that are 98% water,” asJonathan Bostockframed it.I agree that the form factor for beverages (cans and bottles of water-heavy liquids that were made from concentrate before they left the factory) is inefficient. Some companies like Soda Stream have provided an alternative. But a mainstream shift from these “prepared beverages” to a simpler and cheaper concentrate/powder is imaginable. One of my portfolio companies nearing launch tackles a number of common everyday items (like mouthwash, for example) that are currently distributed in plastic-heavy and expensive bottles but could be distributed in far more economized and concentrated ways. We’ve long known about the concept of an individual’s “carbon footprint,” but the consumer-friendly options to manage it have been limited. This will change, as such products become cheaper and more desirable. Within 3–5 years, the majority of the prepared food we order from delivery networks like UberEats and GrubHub, or modern food brands like sweetgreen, will come from commissaries, not actual restaurants. The notion of fulfilling food orders at peak times from busy street-level restaurants optimized for hospitality not delivery is ridiculous, and yet it is today’s status-quo. In the not-so-distant future, most restaurants will consider their storefronts as flagship experiences for their brand, and will scale their higher-margin revenue from fulfilling and delivering orders out of commissaries, operated by third-parties or “collo-commissaries” shared with a few other restaurant brands. These third-party brands will compete with “house brands” that the big delivery platforms create and fulfill on their own. (5)A new era of personalization that antiquates generalized products and services. The ultimate promise of personalized experiences from artificial intelligence has, thus far, been mostly limited to advertising and ad-supported product experiences. Sure, there are smattering of other applications in medicine and your Netflix queue, but I am surprised by how much of daily life is still generalized as opposed to personalized. Online stores still show us every category, restaurants give us menus despite our allergies and diets, and we still become enamored by mass brands. How might artificial intelligence transform our everyday life experiences that would make today’s way of living look utterly ridiculous? Diets and health routines will become ultra personalized.Clay Hebert‏ suggests we will will look back in disbelief “that we were all searching for the ideal one-size-fits-all diet vs. something individually customized.” “Same for drugs and supplements,” he adds. “You’ll take a pill with your name on it, customized for you. We all will.” Whether it is vitamins, diets, medical treatments, workout routines, or your shampoo and soap, the era of personalization will render all of these mass market brands obsolete. With insights about what makes each of us unique, we’ll opt for the personally tailored option of everything. Your mobile food and grocery apps will only display personalized menus (excluding any ingredients you’re allergic to, and taking diet into consideration).One of my investments,Pintohas spent years analyzing and classifying every type of produce and packaged good you’d find in a grocery store, and has used this data to enable companies like Whole Foods to offer a personalized experience to patrons. Imagine, as the interface of shopping changes through new mobile grocery apps or augmented reality, using this data combined with your own preference data to make the entire shopping experience tailored to you. If you’re Gluten Free, every experience and menu you’ll see will be Gluten Free. Education will finally become tailored to the individual.Brian Guenther‏shared his conviction that we’ll look back in disbelief “that a factory model of education, unpersonalized and based on static content, was an acceptable model for educating our children.” I hope he’s right. If teachers could deliver a more personalized curriculum, where every digital “text book” adjusts using ai to accommodate each student’s strengths and weaknesses, I think such tech would unleash entirely new (and more effective) forms of education. More brands will emerge designed for micro audiences.As some of you know, I’ve had a long-standing fascination in microbrands.” I wrote about this back in March in a post called “Attack of the Micro Brands” and the topic has since been explored in the Wall Street Journal in an article called “Why You’re Buying Products From Companies You’ve Never Heard Of” byChristopher Mims. This is a major commerce trend that impacts the full “stack” of the design, production, marketing, and distribution of consumer products. I’ve made a few bets in this space over the years like Warby Parker (glasses), Outdoor Voices (everyday athletic apparel), Roman (men’s health care), Smalls For Smalls (pet food), FridaBaby (products for babies and moms), and have also been fascinated by the “picks and shovels” companies powering this trend like Assembled Brands (provides tailored financing), Lumi (packaging and logistics), among others. I think we’ll see a lot more of this in the year ahead. (6)A “great awakening” from what we learn about ourselves that will transform our lives. I think we’ll look back at the next 5–10 years as a “great awakening” of sorts for our understanding of our bodies, psychology, and decisions. We’ll realize how blind we were to ourselves, ignorant of caloric intake, nutrient absorption, chemical exposure, UV light exposure, and the list goes on. Once we have accurate and real-time measurements, and understand the ramifications, we’ll have a new level of awareness that will change how we live.As we reflect, we’ll find it ridiculous “that we were willing to accept the health risks of sleeping less than 7 hours every night” (Ben Gilbert‏ ), that “soda was legal for kids under 18” (Vitaly Gordon)‏, “that we had to go to a doctor/hospital to get our vitals” (Steve Kaliski‏ ), and that we “dieted without real-time body feedback (thinking blood/sugar/hormones)” (Andreas Klinger). The media we consume, and the frequency in which we consume it, will become a more conscious choice. We will also become hyper aware of how we spend our time and where we allocate attention. The fact that our devices now count minutes spent in apps (and proactively cut us off), coupled with the (long awaited) mainstream interest in “quantified self” will have a big impact on what sources of news/media/info/entertainment we seek, for what price, and under what terms. Our personal lives and decisions will become more informed by data and less governed by instinct.I have a good friend who once told me about his dating spreadsheet, where he attempts to understand what worked and didn’t work on dates and in relationships so that he could better understand the patterns. It sounds crazy, but perhaps it will feel just as crazy in ten years to make any important life decision without data analysis? One of my portfolio co’s,Airtable, is reimagining the “spreadsheet” to be a more intelligent, customizable, and interactive way to track and analyze any kind of data. Among Airtable’s open source templates you’ll find airtables for tracking your pet’s medical history, apartment hunting, your favorite books, andmany more. With consumer-friendly tools that pack the power of deep data analysis, the possibilities are endless. (7)We’ll want stronger relationships, fewer loose connections. No doubt, the state of social networking has degraded into a small number of mass-adopted applications driven by vanity and FOMO. Under the hood, most social networking and media products that proliferate our lives are optimized to keep us growing our networks and scrolling mindlessly through never-ending updates. As a result, we’ve ended up with larger loosely connected networks that provide more noise than signal for what actually matters to us. But something is changing in our desires and tolerances. We’re starting to mock these platforms, limit our time with them, or all-together delete our accounts. Perhaps it is our natural biological response to a superficial stimuli that has started to deteriorate our collective happiness and productivity? I anticipate (and hope) that the social networks of the future focus more on the problems to solve as opposed to fighting for our attention. What factors will drive these new social products? Depth > Breadth: Now that we all have LinkedIn and at least one Facebook product, we can summon pretty much anyone’s digital profile with a simple search. We don’t need another network for everyone where people carefully curate and anxiously post content to a massive network of acquaintances at best, stalkers at worst. Instead, we want to learn more about fewer people. We want to know where our closest friends are. We want to make meaningful intros for the people we care about. The early era of social network was all about vanity, as people sought to accumulate “likes” and reach as opposed to meaningful exchange. No wonder “chat” has been called “the next social network.” We want technology to scale our direct connections. We need a product like Path, which came half a decade too early. And we need to rethink core mechanics: this network should be decentralized to some extent, it shouldn’t be ad-supported, it should have some lean-forward defaults for sharing location and recommendations that would only work in a closed and trusted network, and it should offer alternative interfaces like voice (AirPods) and AR (when the time comes). Social tech will become an intimate endeavor- a way to connect with the people most close to us and, more importantly, connect with our own past.Colby Saenz‏ suggested on Twitter that we’ll look back in disbelief, “that we never valued the importance of personal (and private) documenting of our lives/thoughts/ideas.” Modern social products will account for this. (8)Artificial intelligence will protect us more than we ever expected. Finally, for all the talk of the dangers of artificial intelligence, we tend to skip over the fact that identity theft is a raging problem, that data breaches happen every day, that we’re always trying to moderate the impact of tech in our lives, and that spam and scams have become an everyday reality. Artificial intelligence is our best chance at a step-function more peaceful existence. More positivity by default:For all the talk of ai helping convert customers and optimize product experiences, we haven’t thought about the implications of people using ai to better control what comes into their lives. Like Apple’s default options for ceasing notifications on the phone and blocking certain ads by default in Safari, we may choose to empower ai to proactively “protect us” in the future, which will change the game for advertising and media. Imagine setting default preferences on every device at the OS level to not only block ads, but block malicious characters, non-fact-checked content, and certain notifications at certain times based on ai-analysis of your calendar. Lots of innovation to come here. More productivity: When I was in Tokyo recently, I spent some time with journalists and customers that were asking about how ai would replace creative professionals and somehow automate creative work. On the contrary, I explained, ai will help us humans focus our energy on the creative part and spend less time on everything else in-between. All of the work we’re doing at Adobe using artificial intelligence is intended to reduce the mundane, repetitive, and annoying parts of the creative process. I think this is generally how ai will be used: to not only automate the mundane, but also to unleash our uniquely human capabilities. Fewer mistakes: Seth Godin recentlysuggested in a postthat, despite all the technological advance, our devices still default to 3am when scheduling a meeting at 3, lets us leave a $5,650 tip if we accidentally put our PIN in the card reader when it asks for the tip amount, and so on. His point is: “Are you sure” is something that humans know to ask but machines don’t. Ai should solve this in the coming years. Data will become a natural resource: Will the oceans of data that power artificial intelligence be classified as a natural resource the enriches its citizens, much like oil is managed in countries like Norway? If it is a natural residue of our everyday activity, why shouldn’t it belong to society? Hey, who knows? These future forecasting exercises are fun, if nothing more. They spark conversation and debate with people you can learn from, so bring it on.

Not all technology are in mission to destroy the earth. Not all technology are in mission to destroy the earth. Let’s see how internet and computers are saving the planet . Personal Computers— Imagine an office without a computer , stacks of files , pens , papers , shredders , dustbins . Where do papers come from . ? From Trees of-course , What about the amount of fuel and energy spent on its harvest .? What about the transportation of raw wood , the industry that process it , Chemical waste generated in such process, Solid waste thats leftover , finally the packing and transportation for these to reach your hands or the office . All type of pollution is covered in this process like Air , Water , Noise , Land Pollution and not to mention the amount of deforestation. And don’t forget the Pencils we use write on them , that’s the whole story once more. And Disposal of these wastes are again gonna have their effects. E-Mail— Emails may be a quick and easy way of communications , but its one the best planet saver , Just think about the number of mails the postal network use to process . Again the papers and waste generated . The Pollution caused by transportation of these physical mails. Instant Messaging— Many Official bodies still prefer use of physical mails over E-mails but no individual prefers to send a Physical mail thanks to our trust on our postal system that only one in every ten mail we send will reach the destination that to with in the same year, isn’t that a great achievement .But very unlikely people are not kind hearted to appreciate such effort and rather choose to move on to much cheaper and reliable ways to communicate, through calls ,sms and instant messaging . This actually saves papers by the billions , assuming we are one of the most populous countries. And also save in huge amounts on transportation based pollution. Shopping— We had to step into a hundred shops before we were satisfied to make a purchase , now it’s just 10 clicks away. Well technology has made it simple and efficient , no physical shops , then no waste of electricity , maintenance. Goods can be stored and retrieved in compact spaces . This save a 100 trips to and from shops by a hundred people to just one round trip by a delivery van in the evening. Computer and Internet are not only making us lazy (reduces CO2) , but they also tend to save the planet in a few other ways.

Well, this balderdash is circulating for a while now, and there are posts from 3+ years ago saying that Ruby is dead, but in fact, here we are. AGoogle Trends searchshows that the Ruby interest over time isn’t decaying, but following the same pattern similar technologies are tracing. Also, always keep in mind thatprogramming languages are tools to solve specific problems, and that is why there is no such thing as the best programming language. Ruby has gone through a lot of significant changes during the past year, and it is certainly not dying, but growing and evolving. The year of 2019 has a lot to the Ruby community. Check some of the key points below: A new version of Ruby has been released in December 2018. This release includes a lot of performance improvements and new features, including an initial implementation of a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. To say truly, this new JIT compiler has not achieved its best performance yet, ascovered here, but has a lot of future on it. The Ruby community considers this release as an opening to thenew era of Ruby. While I failed to make Ruby’s JIT production-ready in 2.6, I don’t regret what we’ve done this year. I needed to develop or lead all of the above things for Ruby 2.6, but I believe I can invest my time mainly on performance improvement in Ruby 2.7. —k0kubun While I failed to make Ruby’s JIT production-ready in 2.6, I don’t regret what we’ve done this year.

https://medium.com/@workpath/transparent-db33e8e46a34?source=tag_archive---------184-----------------------,Transparent! How Technology Can Provide Greater Visibility for Everyone Involved in Healthcare in 2019,Written byWorkpath Team,"Workpath Team Follow -- Listen Share Our mission atWorkpathis to redesign how healthcare is delivered. To make this possible, we’re creating technology in 2019 that leads to transparent healthcare for everyone, including patients/consumers, healthcare professionals, healthcare employers, and more. When this happens, complete visibility can help patients and their families make informed choices. In addition, it can increase trust in the patient/caregiver relationship while improving the quality, safety, and efficiency of health systems and other healthcare providers. In short, transparency is critical toward our effort this year to move toward a higher performing healthcare industry at large. But how can technology help? First, let’s understand the push toward transparency over the years and where we’re headed in the year ahead. Let’s dig in. How the Push for Healthcare Transparency Began The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines transparency in healthcare as making all information on quality, efficiency, and consumer experience clearly available to the public in a reliable and understandable manner. When done right, transparency efforts in healthcare can dramatically influence the behaviors of patients, providers, payers, and others to achieve better outcomes. In the early part of the 20thcentury, Ernest Codman, M.D., a pioneering Boston surgeon, introduced the “end result idea” to highlight the importance of following up with each and every patient — and publicly reporting the results. Codman’s novel idea at the time was based on the theory that complete transparency would promote improvement throughout the hospital, encourage greater physician education, and improve patient choice at large. While the foundation for patient transparency was set years ago, it wasn’t until 2001 that the IOM published recommendations for increased information availability, so that patients and families could make more informed choices. The IOM report brought attention to the need for a standardized set of performance indicators for safety, patient satisfaction, and outcomes to be made public. The movement toward informed healthcare choices was reinforced by proponents of Consumer-Driven Health Care (CDHC), an often-debated, market-driven approach to healthcare based on publicly available information on price and quality of care to encourage informed shopping for high-quality, low-cost healthcare. By 2006, a Presidential Executive Order called for all federal agencies, and sponsored federal healthcare insurance programs, to increase their transparency around pricing and quality. Fast forward to today and multiple healthcare organizations continue to push for transparency and performance measures, including the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the American Medical Association’s Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement, National Quality Forum (NQF), The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), just to name a few. In addition, the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual clearly supports transparency in all patient and physician relationships. Physicians are expected to share whatever info is needed to help a patient understand their situation, including cost, as well as the experience of the clinician and any errors made in the course of the care. All such information must be shared openly, honestly and in a comprehensible way to empower the patient. While the factors involved in healthcare transparency are complex and heavily debated, it’s clear that increasing transparency throughout the healthcare industry benefits those receiving care. A Commonwealth Fund survey of American healthcare, as an example, found that 95 percent of healthcare opinion leaders believe that having information on the quality of physicians and hospitals is important. Similarly, a survey from Center for Health System Change Research on patients seeking care outside of the traditional hospital settings demonstrates that transparency around quality of care is important when choosing a physician and other services. In addition, a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute shows that health plan enrollees routinely seek information on provider quality above all else. While criticism of performance rating programs has been a natural part of the push toward greater transparency, most healthcare leaders agree that high-quality care starts with greater visibility into quality improvement efforts, evaluation programs, methodology behind ratings, better use of data, ease of use, understandability, and a process for registering complaints. Our role at Workpath is to further grow this movement toward greater transparency through the use of innovative technology that can help improve the healthcare experience on both sides — the patients receiving care and those providing care. How Technology Can Help Improve Transparency Let’s take a look at some of the features created by Workpath to increase transparency in 2019 for everyone receiving and delivering care. Healthcare organizations leveraging Workpath’s technology have reported that the following features have improved their workflow and thus added greater visibility for patients and caregivers alike. For those delivering care, specialists are now using Workpath’s platform to set up their profile with desired drive radii from their home location or their current GPS location, set their work availability, and choose their preferred notification hours. With this layer of visibility, Workpath then automatically matches the right specialist available to perform a job at the right time and place. The specialist then automatically receives a push notification for any appointments/shifts that fall within their desired drive radius and work availability. Using Workpath’s HIPAA-compliant technology, everyone involved in care (the patient, the specialist delivering care to the patient, and the healthcare organization assigning the labor to perform the care) is kept fully updated about all appointments — from the moment an appointment is assigned to its completion. This provides the patient full transparency into the process while giving the healthcare organization greater visibility into every aspect of the care provided by their specialists. Healthcare organizations using Workpath technology can track all appointments and shifts in one place. Appointments can be added by their customers, team, or through an API integration with an existing system or EHR (like Allscripts, Epic, and Cerner). Through the Workpath dashboard, healthcare organizations have the ability to track all appointments on one page with real-time status updates, so every detail is made visible. And by using Workpath’s procedure intelligence, the specialist who is assigned an appointment automatically receives step-by-step instructions for each service to better control quality in the field. For patients, transparency is increased through automated confirmation, reminder, and real-time status messages via text and email so that they are alerted to every aspect of their appointment. Meanwhile the healthcare organization can use Workpath’s technology to add tags to each specialist in order to keep track of certifications, licenses, and specifics for all services and members of their workforce. This lets healthcare partners stratify their workforce to ensure the right people have access to the right appointments. Using Workpath’s mileage tracking feature helps healthcare organizations automate and better manage navigation and mileage tracking, thus eliminating unnecessary phone calls, emails, and messages from their labor about mileage, directions, and additional time spent documenting their travels for each appointment. This popular geolocation feature offers all the information a specialist needs: the estimated mileage to an appointment based on their current location, the ideal route to reach the appointment in time, and visibility into the actual mileage to deliver care to the patient. Once a specialist is on their way to an appointment, they can use the navigation feature built into the Workpath app to be certain that they never miss an appointment and are always on time! The patient also receives a route tracking link, via text, so they can track the specialist when they are on the way the appointment and view the estimated time of arrival. Using their Workpath mobile app, specialists receive a push notification when an appointment or shift is assigned to them. In addition, push notifications alert the caregiver if the time/day or address is updated, thereby ensuring appointments are never missed and details never fall through the cracks. To further enhance transparency, both the patient and the specialist receive an appointment reminder 24 hours before an appointment starts. The specialist can use the Workpath app to select their status (such as “On the Way,” “Arrived,” “In Progress,” “Shipping,” “Complete”) which keeps the healthcare organization updated in real-time. The GPS Tracking feature on the Workpath app will alert the patient as well, letting them know when their specialist is on “On the Way” or has “Arrived.” For additional transparency within the healthcare organization, the specialists can add notes to the appointment log for every appointment using the Workpath app. By making visibility a key component in every aspect of Workpath, healthcare organizations and caregivers can view their history of completed appointments/shifts with all details (time/date, service completed, payment, ordering organization). Everyone Benefits When Healthcare Is Transparent Rapid advances in technology by companies like Workpath are improving the push toward greater transparency for all parties involved in healthcare. Today’s technology makes it possible to improve the way healthcare organizations operate and how they seamlessly communicate with every stakeholder. Because of greater transparency, stakeholders can now access, track, and analyze critical information about every single appointment, how it was delivered, when it was delivered, and the results. For healthcare organizations wishing to be responsive to marketplace expectations, technology by companies likeWorkpathmakes it possible to increase transparency and enhance their interactions with those receiving care and those delivering care.",Workpath Team,https://medium.com/@workpath?source=post_page---byline--db33e8e46a34---------------------------------------,0,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg,2019-01-03T15:57:54.299Z,Medium

People who are familiar with programming languages like Java, C++, may have difficulties in using Javascript. Those languages areobject-oriented, unlike classic Javascript (ES5). However, Javascript has evolved a lot in the last years. We are now able to write object-oriented JS code, withES6. (If you don’t know ES6, clickherefor more). But there is also another way with additional features:Typescript. NOTE:In order to understand Typescript, you need to have at least some basic knowledge of Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming. NOTE:In order to understand Typescript, you need to have at least some basic knowledge of Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming. Typescript can be explained as a superset of Javascript. It means that every Javascript (also ES6 & newer versions) code isvalidTypescript code, but Typescript comes with some additional features: Strong-typed variables Object-oriented programming In Typescript, we can define a variable’s type with thestrong-typingfeature like we define a variable in Java or C++. Additionally, we are able to writeobject-orientedcode with Typescript. Another important point is that Angular uses Typescript. So if you want to learn Angular, it’s an advantage to know some Typescript first. Let’s see how to start using Typescript… Before we can use Typescript, we need to install it on our computer. We can install Typescript with NPM, so if you don’t have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it fromhere. After the installation is completed, go to your terminal and type node -v to check the version: Installing Typescript Now you can install Typescript with NPM. Again from your terminal, type the following command to install Typescript: This command will install Typescript globally so you can use it in any project. After the installation completed, you can verify it withtsc -v. Now you can start using Typescript. Create a new file from your code editor and the extension of the file must be.ts. NOTE:Typescript files have a.tsextension. NOTE:Typescript files have a.tsextension. Browsers don’t understand Typescript code, so later it needs to get translated to Javascript. This command creates a Javascript file automatically and translates your Typescript code JS. Let’s move on with the main features of Typescript. Different from JS, we can define the types of our variables asnumber, string, boolean, array, anyand much more. Below you can see some examples of strong typing: Class & Interface Another important feature of TS is that we can writeobject-oriented code. For example, we can defineclassesandinterfaces: We have created a Student class and later we can create instances with thenewkeyword: After assigning theStudent( ) object, we don’t need to declare its type again. It will be done automatically by Typescript. Constructors In Object-Oriented Programming, we have an important method calledconstructor( ). Every class has actually a default constructor method, and it is called when we create an instance of that class: Thequestion markmakes the parametersoptional. Access Modifiers In Object-Oriented Programming, access modifiers are being used for restricting or allowing to access the variables of a class from outside. There are 3 types of access modifiers: Public— Allows access from outside of a class Private— Doesn’t allow access from outside of a class Protected— Allows access only within a class and its derived classes All members of a class arePublicby default, this is also aninterview question:) All members of a class arePublicby default, this is also aninterview question:) So we can (and should) restrict access from outside by adding theprivatekeyword to a class’s members: Javascript is evolving and will continue to evolve. Typescript is just one of the branches. I hope now you have a better understanding of Typescript, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask them in the comment section.

Its patchwork system of regulation by private entities satisfies no one, yet it is likely to endure for the foreseeable future. By way of explanation, consider a case in which authority is (mostly) centralized and the environment is (mostly) controlled: my own. I am a professor, and if a student regularly made offensive remarks in class, I would meet with that person and try to persuade him or her to desist. (For the record, this has never happened to me.) If the person continued, I would at some point seek to ban the student from my class, with the support of my university. Yet this solution is not as straightforward as it seems. Maybe it’s good if you trust my judgment, but it is not readily scalable. It only works because such incidents are so rare.

Entrepreneurs usually blur the lines of what their startup is, what it will be, and what it should be. This is fine until you try to start planning around those stories. At that point, you need to be asking: What are the priorities today and how do we execute on those priorities without mortgaging the future? The reverse question is just as important: How much time do we spend working on those new things that aren’t generating revenue yet? Every startup should have three stories, loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling. An easy way to think about it is a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show, the writers are usually working on three storylines: Story A: Story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode (or maybe a two-parter). Story B: Story with a longer arc that lasts a few episodes or more. This current episode will advance the plot of Story B in smaller…",Joe Procopio,https://me.dm/@jproco,1012,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png,2023-11-08T19:00:07.653Z,Medium

https://medium.com/@dzen.fedor13/features-of-digital-renaissance-using-technology-for-our-own-good-e25e9df91d10?source=tag_archive---------80-----------------------,Features of Digital Renaissance : using technology for our own good.,Written byTed Dzen,"Ted Dzen Follow -- 2 Listen Share Turn on this song and go on reading (be sure) Turn on this song and go on reading (be sure) We created digital — is digital shaping us now? People created technology which fetched our current idea of digital, though we haven’t realized it yet. By using social networks, messengers, all online apps we have been partly showing our inner self to the others. Digital have just structured and focused it in one point or network node , if you will — our phone. Those tales about GDPR and other data protection measures tell us that our minds are no more privately closed as they used to be. Undoubtedly, IT giants have too much power over a steering wheel, however, being proactive subjects or passive stones it’s our choice to make.Below I figured out some rules we can use to collectively protect ourselves in the world of digital. Renaissance philosopher Campanella wrote a book called “ The city of sun”. It’s known as the first utopia ever written. He’s managed to describe an ideal city from both ruling and living standpoints. Equal rights and wealth distribution, secure life, efficient work segmentation, self organization, deified humanity — these are main features of this clockwork-like divine city. Even though a prophetic start-up of Italian renaissance era have never been materialized , its idea permeated the minds of his followers (one of the most modern — was Jack Fresco). If fact, digital world created quite hostile environment for these ideas to find real life applications. In particular, online communities became , suffice to say, digital cities of sun. I wish Campanella could observe this. All in all, such an architecture can give us much more power than we’ve ever held in our collective hands. Saying about tools we can use: Saying about tools we can use: Super-fast flow of information and world changing rate demands new through organization technics. By means of specific digital measures people can live an easier life by decreasing the informational load at least in half. This can be done by organizing your digital self. Algorithms are cornerstones that software architects use to make us do what they will in response monetize: likes,shares and so on and so forth. They achieve it by exploiting our pscycological vulnerabilities. Intermittent variable rewards, sudo-free choice mechanisms, FOMSI(google it ), social approval , social awareness — these triggers of their digital guns aiming to confuse our minds. However, It have been not so clear that pretty anyone can operate this variables to digitally control oneself in one way or another. Besides we all had our minds digitalized, as I wrote above, let me put it this way: digital makes shots from the parallel side of the mirror, when we are not seeing it. It’s a perfect way to reflect on what we are doing and self-monitor our lives: our bad or good habits, misdeeds. If we used it,we could, it term, easily draw conclusions of our doings. Moreover, these mirrors have an ability to save,on programmer’s slang, log files or, in other words, your activity. There is a saying:wise men learn by other men’s mistakes; fools by their own.In digital era we all have an opportunity to be wise — we only have to use it. Communication. It is the most important activity in our lives. None of us can find a cozy place in the life without being good at it. It’s a surprise that digital modified the way we communicate with each others. It brought up the notion of socialism and equality. Being perfect decentralised platform, digital has been building communities with the goal to connect people and let us help one another in hard times. Text, memes, voice messages are methods we use spread our thoughts across the net. However, we appeal to them when we speak with somebody in person. There is no more just interpersonal communication — digitally mediated communication crops up. Miracle. Being able to see anyone through, demands anormous amount of knowledge and experience, however, there are several technics we can use to inspect. One of those is digital glasses. Glasses which unblurres your picture of the world, by making it more full and distinct. It happens because wearing them we can see another dimension of our new technological life and change its features however we want. Digital matter is what can be seen. Subliminal meanings , products of object oriented analysis and more comprise it. Interestingly, current mindset gap between older and younger generation can be easily defined by owning this so-called digital glasses. Sum up: Sum up: Everything above can be applied either individually or collectively. Managing yourself and others can be done in another different way. It’s been only tip of an iceberg touched in this section. More in-depth description I will make further articles. Stay tuned, digitalists. Only together we are able to use digital tools and shape the world we are living in.Take on your digital glasses.

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/unit-testing-services-endpoints-and-repositories-in-spring-boot-4b7d9dc2b772?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"How to test services, endpoints, and repositories in Spring Boot",Why unit test endpoints?,"Emre Savcı Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 4 Listen Share In this post I will show you how to write unit tests in spring boot applications. Why is it necessary to write unit test requires another article to explain. But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things. I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes. Why unit test endpoints? Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post. Why unit test services? It should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly. Why unit test repositories? There are several cases to test repositories. Of course we don’t test the framework itself. But we do write unit tests to be sure that our specifications or relations have been implemented correctly. Now it’s time to show you how to test our controllers in spring boot. Let’s imagine we write an application which allows us to save users in a database. We define a user entity, a user service, and a controller. Note: The examples shown in this post are not for real production use architecture Our controller has a dependency on UserService but we aren’t interested in what service does right now. So now let’s write a unit test for our controller to be sure it works correctly. We mocked our service because we don’t need its implementation details. We just test our controller here. We useMockMvchere to test our controller and object mapper for serialization purposes. We setup ouruserService.Save()method to return the desired user object. We passed a request to our controller and after that we checked the returned data with the following line:andExpect(jsonPath(""$.name"").value(request.getName())). We have alsoother methods to use. Here is the list of methods: When we run the test we see that it passes. Now we go to test our UserService. It is quite simple to test. We mock the repository and inject our mocks into UserService. Now when we run the test we’ll see that it passes. Now let’s add a business rule to UserService: let’s say the user must have an email address. We change our save method in UserService as below: When we run the test again, we’ll see a failed test. Before we fix it, let’s write a test that satisfies this business. We wrote a new test that specified that if we send a null email, it’ll throwNullPointerException. Let’s fix the failed test by adding an email to our request: Run both tests: Now we’ve come to testing repositories. We use an in memory h2 database withTestEntityManager. Our repository is defined as below: First configure h2db. Create the file name application.yaml in test -> resources path: And let’s first write a basic test for our repository: save a user and retrieve it: When we run it we’ll see bunch of console output, and also our test passes: Now let’s add another method to our repository for searching for a user via email: And write another test: When we take a look at the console after running the test, we'll see the SQL generated by hibernate: So far so good. We have covered the basics of unit testing with spring boot. Now you don’t have any excuses to not write unit tests! I hope it is clear to you to how to write unit tests for different kinds of purposes.",Emre Savcı,https://medium.com/@mstryoda?source=post_page---byline--4b7d9dc2b772---------------------------------------,409,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg,2019-01-11T00:40:20.473Z,Medium

This one made its way into the hands ofJean-Luc Aufranc, from theCNX Software blog, over the Christmas vacation. “…this is Espressif’s new AI development board featuring voice wakeup, as well as face detection and recognition. It has been built around our flagship chip, ESP32, and it is also equipped with a 2-Megapixel OV 2640 Camera, Microphone, 4 MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM, Micro USB and LED lights on a 21mm × 41mm board.” “…this is Espressif’s new AI development board featuring voice wakeup, as well as face detection and recognition.

With most of themajor machine learning toolsbeing heavily optimised for Arm-based architectures, Espressif with its Tensilica-based chips is in danger of being left behind when it comes to machine learning on the edge. One of the reasons I was so excited bySeeed Studio’s Air602 modulereleased late last year is that it’s a price comparable ESP8266 competitor that’s built on Arm. On the surface, the board itself looks a lot like a neater, more finished version of theprototype Ai-Thinker CAM boardwe saw towards the middle of last year, as well a few of the other ESP32-based camera boards I’ve seen. What’s different here is of course that this is, presumably, going to be an“official”Espressif product and that implies a better level of software support than we’ve seen before. But, at least right now, there doesn’t seem to be any details of the software stack they’re using on the board, although it’s likely to be their ownESP-WHO framework. Which is sort of interesting. In fact, there really doesn’t seem to be manydetails of the new boardat all; there certainly isn’t any information available on theEspressifwebsite. Beyond the handful of boards that got sent out to the community over the Christmas break, the new board hasn’t made it into more general circulation. It isn’t yet for sale, and there is no word on pricing or even a release date. So, now all I have to do is figure out how to get my hands on one…?

And you know what? Unfortunately, they are right (not necessarily about the “cool” part, but about the useful part). Tests are a must! The typical advantages we list when it comes to talking about TDD are real: You write better software. You have protection from breaking the world when new features are introduced. Your software is self-documented. You avoid over-engineering. Even if I’ve always agreed with these advantages, there was a time when I thought that I didn’t need TDD to write good and maintainable software. Of course, now, I know I was wrong, but why did I have this idea despite the shiny magic of the pros? There’s only one reason: it costs a lot. It costs a lot!

It has been overlooked I think but in my opinion it was a very important moment when earlier in 2018 Raullen and Zhijie were teaching a distance learning course regarding Tech of blockchain and IoT at Nicosia’s university. I mean how many projects have done this by trully sincerely sharing their knowledge with new students of the field, personally I’ve only heard IoTeX doing this. Also we’ve seen that recently IoTeX partnered with University of Cincinnati. My question is whether courses like that are still being done or are being planned to be done and why is that important for team of IoTeX to allocate some of the efforts into these spaces of academics? A:First, thank you for the recognition of our academic contribution! As we stated earlier, we think the blockchain industry development heavily relies on the cryptography knowledge base. As the team with solid cryptography background, it is our obligation to explore for more innovations and make more contribution to sharing the knowledge to more talents. That’s why we also open sourced lots of our codes to the public, free to use. That’s also why we always say that there is no “real” competitor in the current blockchain industry — everyone should put lots of work exploring, researching, to strengthen the development and future killer application/ innovations regardless to do it individually or with other companies/research parties. By teaching lessons and working with academic labs, we will have more opportunities to reach more talents, speed up the innovation exploration, and all these will ultimately benefit our own development. Collaborating with top researchers in academia is also crucial for bringing the cutting-edge research innovations to the IoTeX blockchain. Q2. When looking at Iotex core’s insights at Github it can be seen that since June of 2018 there has been quite a downtrend in commits up until now with spikes in August and end of October. Should this be interpreted that the majority of the work has been done and this is actually a good sign? Any clarity please. A:Each project has its own development style. For us, we built everything from zero and finished most of the initial codes in June. Then we slowed down the commit speed intentionally. At the same time, we did several rounds of code review and code refactoring to improve the network. That’s a lot of work which will not be shown by the # of commits. (e.g.https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/pull/371) So the # of commit is not the only factor to evaluate the workload. And usually, we commit our code intensively before every code release so you will see some spikes. It means that we began to freeze our code for final testing, but those codes are built gradually in the past few months. Q3. For important mainnet releases I’m sure the team will conduct various bug bounties for the community so they can potentially find any bugs and work for the hackers would be rewarded but is the team thinking of raising the stakes a bit and paying more and finding very high level hackers globally to test the robustness of the network? Would that be both technically and economically efficient and why? A:Yes we are thinking of launching another round of bug bounty program. We prefer to set a reasonable reward for the contribution since the bug bounty program is not the only way to test the network. In addition, in most of the cases, we not only give a one-time reward for the developers who helped us discovering bugs/vulnerabilities, but also keep the long-term relationship as they will help us working on IoTeX network-related works. We will also have accordance bounty program for these additional contributions. We believe raising the reward to a much higher level is not the only way to approach the high-level hackers. We may utilize a few platforms to help us spread the program details. Q4. Will the Committee of block producers be selected only through a consensus Roll-DPoS mechanism? Or will there be additional mechanisms to eliminate centralization and possible collusion? A:Yes — we are currently in the final stages of designing our block producer ranking and rewarding schemes. The ranking scheme will define how block producers are chosen, and it will not only be reliant on stake / votes but also other factors to prevent centralization and collusion. The rewarding scheme determines how block producers are rewarded for participating in consensus. We will be releasing individual blog posts on both of these schemes over the next month. Q5. What, if any, role will IoT endpoints have in maintaining consensus? Do you plan to protect the endpoint from any attempt to compromise it’s private key if it needs to be stored on an IoT device that might live in a less than secure location? A:IoT devices will not be responsible for maintaining consensus — this task is the exclusive responsibility of IoTeX block producers as our Roll-DPoS consensus mechanism is a variant of delegated proof of stake (DPoS). These block producers have minimum HW/SW requirements to ensure that consensus is processed securely and efficiently. However, IoT devices (acting as full nodes or light nodes) will be responsible for downloading the latest history of transactions so they can participate in transactions. In other words, endpoints will periodically sync the latest version of the blockchain. In addition, the security of endpoints is crucial for any blockchain-based IoT applications since the IoT endpoints are essentially responsible to provide trusted data to the blockchain. For protecting endpoints from compromise, a piece of secure hardware is highly desirable for storing private key on IoT devices. Moreover, a well-designed key management mechanism is also important to ensure the long-term security of IoT systems. Q6. Dear IoTeX Team, Wish you had (or are having!) good holidays. I’ve got one question about Roll-DPoS (or DPoS in general): not speaking of exact numbers/percentages/mechanisms, we know that the block rewards which a BP earns will get shared among those stakeholders who voted that BP, proportionally to their stake. But what about those who voted for all the other candidates that actually did not make it in the candidates pool? Will they be excluded by the rewards sharing? Or is it that all the block rewards from all the BPs get collected and shared among all voters regardless of who they did actually vote? Thank you. A:The sharing of block rewards from block producers to those that voted for them will not be built-in to the protocol (as is the case in PoS projects like Tezos). Instead, it is up to the block producer to determine how they will allocate their block rewards. For example, some may choose to re-distribute 80% of block rewards to those that voted for them (weighted by votes), and commit the remaining 20% to further development of the platform. We have even seen some block producers re-distribute 100%+ (i.e., they will pay more than the block rewards) to win votes. This is ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis — there may even be some block producers that do not re-distribute any funds to their voters, but will still be voted in by contributing to the network in other ways (i.e., DApp / tool builders, project awareness). As such, there will not be any defined rules requiring BPs to share / not share their block rewards. From IoTeX’s perspective, we will only provide voters with high degree of transparency as far as block producer metrics / uptime to help people make the most informed decision. Q7. Hi! How did spend holidays? 1) to you any offers from your competitors on IoTeX to technologies sometime arrived? if yes, that what? 2) in the future you plan merging with other companies? 3) we know that IoT technologies help to save significantly money to ordinary users, but further this technology will rise in price or become cheaper for ordinary users? A:Hello! The team got to spend precious time with our families over the holiday / New Year break, but we also worked diligently. We are more inspired than ever to do great things in 2019! 1/2) We do not see other blockchain companies as “competitors” and we actually work with other similar projects on research and development. We are happy to be part of the blockchain industry which is very collaborative. However, we will not “merge” with other companies but we will definitely continue to build strategic partnerships with DApp builders, investors, and other companies. Our goal is to build our community with talented and passionate companies and community members! 3) IoT technology is advancing very quickly — not only are devices / chips becoming more cheaper and powerful, but new connectivity technologies (i.e., 5G) will greatly improve the capabilities of the IoT industry. We feel this trend will continue — today’s IoT capabilities will become cheaper, but new exciting technologies will emerge at higher price points that may replace some existing capabilities as well.

What Simon and the other AI proponents failed to appreciate are the numerousunforeseen challengesinvolved in relying solely on machines. The AI field first emerged more than half a century ago. But it’s only been in the last ten years, due in large part to the rapid growth and democratization of machine learning, that we are starting to see the full potential of AI. Today, there are countlessopen-source AItools that help any entrepreneur get up and running on AI quickly, including Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit, and Amazon Machine Learning. These advancements have acceleratedthe transitionfrom a model that involves AI assisting humans to one that involves humans assisting AI.

Johnson & Johnson is using AI to help parentscustomize their child’s sleepcare. Unilever is trying to useblockchain to improve its ad buying. The list of traditional companies experimenting with ‘buzzwordy’ tech goes on and on. The list of traditional companies experimenting with ‘buzzwordy’ tech goes on and on. But here’s the thing: adopting — and thensuccessfullyimplementing —innovative technologies requires more than just investing in robots, AI, and blockchain. It requires a fundamental understanding of the concepts and processes that have enabled tech companies to thrive and dominate the corporate landscape of today. For most old-school companies that were founded many decades ago, this often means reworking many of their core processes and fundamental beliefs. Here are a few tech-pioneered concepts and processes which could prove particularly transformative for more traditional, less “tech” companies. In many traditional industries — whether it’s restaurant supplies, TV advertising, or supplement manufacturing — it can take potential customersweeksto get a simple price quote for their order. You have to speak to multiple different reps (often telling them the same information), navigate opaque monopolistic supply chains, get multiple quotes to understand if you are being scammed or not, among other painful, mind-numbingly tedious tasks. To say the process is inefficient would be an understatement. Compare that with how easy it is to buy an ad on Google or Facebook, in which pricing options are transparent and accessible. It’s night and day. Compare that with how easy it is to buy an ad on Google or Facebook, in which pricing options are transparent and accessible. It’s night and day. But the thing is, now that we as consumers know that a seamless process is possible, our expectations have changed. This type of seamless process is not just “nice-to-have” at this point. It has now become, “If you don’t have it, I’ll find somebody else who does.” Consumers want simple processes where they can get their answers easily and quickly. Companies who meet that demand will have a clear cut advantage; and those that don’t… well, I don’t see them being around much longer, unless the government forces you to use them or subsidizes them completely (yes, I’m talking about you, U.S. Postal Service). This is something we all learned back in Econ 101. If the demand for your product or service is high and customers are willing to pay more for it, it doesn’t make sense for you to keep your prices static. It’s a matter of uncapping your customers’ max spend potential. It’s a matter of uncapping your customers’ max spend potential. Uber’s surge pricing is a great example of a company optimized to do exactly that. Surge pricing has allowed Uber to redefine the scarcity economics of the personal transportation market. E-Commerce is another space that has leveraged dynamic pricing very well. Above is a 3-year price chart of a Waterpik Water Flosser on Amazon. As you can see, the prices have fluctuated constantly, and have varied as much as 250% between the minimum and maximum amounts. Some traditional players do use dynamic pricing, too, like airlines, hotels, and theMLB, but many don’t, offering only one flat rate. In the end, having a static pricing model is just leaving money on the table. A great pioneer of this has been Amazon Web Services, the most successful cloud infrastructure service on the planet. As of last year, this single Amazon department had made roughly$10 billionin profit. There’s a lot that accounts for AWS’s success — and removing customers’ capex concerns entirely is one major factor. There are some companies trying this now in more traditional industries, too. For example, Travis Kalanick’s new CloudKitchens is trying to do this with restaurant real estate.Metromileis doing this with car insurance (charging customers for car insurance by the mile). ZipCar, Getaround, and Turo have been doing this successfully with urban car usage, too. What these companies show is that no matter your industry, with enough thought (and tech under the hood), itispossible to ditch the middleman and revamp your bulk pricing structures for something more efficient. Tuft & Needle — a company now doing more than $100M in yearly revenue — didn’t just create a great product and start selling it on a whim. Rather, they only launched after running different product concepts to different landing pages and testing, purposefully, which concepts resulted in conversions. There is agreat podcast with Tuft & Needle’s co-founder JT Marinothat talks about this part of their pre-launch journey. Testing a bunch of ‘fake products’ — which look legitimate but are not actually ready for sale — is a common practice for e-commerce startups. Justin Mares talks about how he validated the idea for his new bone broth startup, Kettle & Fire, in about two weeks and for under $100 in a greatSumo blog post. It’s easy to run Facebook ads to a lot of different concepts and see what resonates and with whom. $500 of Facebook ads and 30 minutes of setup could literally save your company millions of dollars. However, even with all this easy pre-development testing available, many companies today still commit major R&D dollars into a productbefore they’re confident it will sell. Similarly to testing product features and demand, many tech companies also test a lot of branding and design changes at a small scale before committing to them at large. We did this a lot at Glu Mobile and Dairy Free Games when working on new game concepts. Since the timeline for developing a AAA game is often multiple years, developers will frequently test many variations of their theming, art style, icons, branding, etc. These tests are done with just mockup graphics and simulated videos. Gaming studios will then run those assets through specialized testing tools, likeSplitmetricsand StoreMaven, that take the ad clicker to a simulated app store. But even outside of just gaming, this is a common practice in the tech industry to testeverythingbefore sending it out to customers. But even outside of just gaming, this is a common practice in the tech industry to testeverythingbefore sending it out to customers. Email subject lines is the most obvious example. A more extreme example is Marissa Meyertesting 41 different shades of bluein the design process at Google. If you’re just starting out with this, theOptimizely bloghas a lot of ideas on design and branding elements that you can A/B test. If you can promise customers a more personalized or customizable experience, they’ll either pay more for your product, convert faster, or use your product longer. Over the long run, all of this leads to more revenue. A good example of personalization, again, comes from mobile gaming. If you look at the top-performing games like Clash Royale, Game of War, or Contest of Champions, many of the deals that they offer in their stores are highly personalized, and are aimed to solve an immediate need for the specific player who sees the offer. There are also countless mainstream examples of successful personalization spearheaded by consumer tech companies. Amazon, Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify have all built sophisticated personalization and recommendation algorithms to give each user just the right product, show, or song at just the right time. Where personalization is often overlooked by the non-tech crowd is in marketing and SEO. Where personalization is often overlooked by the non-tech crowd is in marketing and SEO. Zapier, a company that helps people automate mundane cross-app interactions, personalized thousands of landing pages to be hyper-targeted to their users’ search queries. As their CEO,Wade Foster, explains:“We set up landing pages for every combination of app-to-app that you could possible connect. So if you’re searching for Groove and JIRA, ideally Zapier is in the results.” In order to do any of the this, however — to A/B test, personalize products, or offer dynamic pricing — your companymustrun sound analytics. You have to understand what affects your users’ behavior. You have to be able to discern why certain products sell well, or why certain campaigns perform well, and others don’t. And in order to do this effectively, you need to invest in your analytics infrastructure. Unfortunately, most companies — even tech companies — overlook their analytics tooling because it doesn’t qualify as something that is “core product.” Zynga disproves that. They were, in fact, one of the companies that spearheaded effective big data analytics. Some have even said that Zynga is really a “Big Data Company Disguised as a Gaming Company.” Mark Pincus, Zynga’s founder, bet big on data. As he explains on theMasters of Scale podcast: “We were pushing it more than anybody because we went to tracking every click and analyzing it at a time that they were using Google Analytics. And we were investing so much and we had so many people on it that we kept getting called stupid, that people said, ‘Zynga has 50 people and this company is doing the same thing with 10. Zynga has 300 people and this company is doing the same with 20 or 50…’ because we wanted to over-invest in knowing the data.” If you’ve bought anything on Wish.com recently — which is on track to do over $2 billion in revenue this year — you’ve probably seen many gamified elements in their store. You can spin the wheel for a once-a-day Deal Dash discount. You can earn reward points with each purchase. And almost everything, from an Instant Offer to your checkout process, has some countdown timer attached to it. While Wish has perhaps taken gamification elements to an extreme, many marketplaces and review platforms, like eBay, Yelp, and Airbnb, offer gamified elements to their users, too. These platforms use gamification to incentivize the types of user behaviors they want to see on their platforms. 9: Developing Compulsion Loops Up until recently, compulsion loops have been a sort of hidden concept, one that tech companies exploited stealthily. This changed when EA became a hot subject of a“loot box” controversy. While the full psychology of compulsion is too long for this article, one of the most popularized examples of compulsion loops are “loot boxes”. At their core, they’re what psychologists callskinner boxes: things that give users variable rewards for the same repeated action. While it may seem counter-intuitive, simply rewarding someone every time (and with the same reward) when they do an action is NOT the best way to have them continue doing that action. Instead, it’s a lot more addicting and motivating to vary up both the reward itself and the likelihood of getting that reward. This is the reason that gambling (and gaming) is more addicting and stimulating than a predictable, fixed-reward task, like a job that pays a fixed steady wage. Subscription commerce startups, like Birchbox and LootCrate, are good examples of companies built around the simple compulsion loop of variable rewards. They deliver a novel set of goods to the subscriber each month. A more old-school example of this is Pokemon cards, which effectively were a physical loot box, and a highly addicting one at that. If you’re interested in exploring how to apply compulsion loops (and other gaming concepts) to real world scenarios, I recommend taking a read through Jane McGonigal’s book,Reality is Broken. Over time, a lot of the tech-pioneered fundamentals that I’ve covered above will become the new standard across a lot of traditional industries, be it manufacturing, consumer packaged goods, or real estate. As consumers’ expectations shift toward easier, faster, and more personalized experiences, the companies that are able to deliver on those pillars will be the ones that survive. So, when it comes to adopting new tech, it’s critical that companies think through their processes, supply chains, and strategies at a more fundamental level instead of just building buzzwords on top of a rotting foundation.

When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.”(I Corinthians 13:11)“Improvising: having the skill to go with the mistake, rather than against it.” Elements of Jazz: From Cakewalks to Fusion(The Great Courses, Chantilly, VA) “When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.”(I Corinthians 13:11) “Improvising: having the skill to go with the mistake, rather than against it.” Elements of Jazz: From Cakewalks to Fusion(The Great Courses, Chantilly, VA) We learn a skill by following prescribed practices, connected and time-phased by scripts — we plan. We then learn to improvise as we select, modify, and perform these practices on the fly. Planning When we are first learning a craft, whether it is public speaking, music, project management, or cooking, we accumulate a toolkit of skills, one tool at a time, along with some concept of the rules for the use of each. At first, we learn one basic tool, such as the hammer, finding out which end to hold, what part is used to drive the nail, how hard to hit, and the like. We eventually master the use of the hammer, learning the “what,” but we have yet to learn the “why” — just when do you use a hammer? Then, to execute an entire project, we must learn the “what” and the “why” of many tools — saw, level, adhesives — and learn the script for moving from one tool to another. Building the script of the sequence of which tool to use when, and how to use it, constitutes the planning of an endeavor. Giving a talk? Then perhaps you write out each word of what you plan to say. Then you likely read it. Your audience cringes as it receives the muttered, over planned results of your preparation. Perhaps you advance to using bullet points, either on a notecard or on a projected slide, simply to tell you what you wish to describe next. Maybe you give yourself a running start by writing out only the first sentence or two of your talk, then move to the bullet points. In like manner, as exemplified by the image of two settings of George and Ira Gershwin’s song “Love Walked In,” we can try to script every possible nuance of playing that song, as shown in the left image of an arrangement by Percy Grainger. “Slowly flowly” is the tempo, and the score on a later page even advises how to play the trill like woggle: “N.B. The woggle should be played as fast as possible, but not necessarily with an exact number of woggle-notes to the beat.” Too much detail? Not at all! The piano arrangement fits together like a tightly-crafted Swiss watch. Its construction is as much an art as its source material. However, the artist playing it will spend dozens of hours learning it. Several artists, plus my own experience, suggest that it might take 2,000 times the length of a piece to practice it to the point of playing it, from memory, as well as one’s technique permits. For this four-minute piece, that would constitute 133 hours. In like manner, rules have developed for various games. If chess player White moves this way, then player Black should move that way. People even “game” business meetings with potential clients by planning: “If they ask this, you answer that!” Likewise, a comprehensive set of tools has developed for planning projects, from jobs as simple as mowing the lawn to as complicated as building a bridge. Quality initiatives seek to document the processes used to execute complicated endeavors, hence providing ways to educate newcomers, assurance that steps are completed in the right order, and means to memorize changes discovered that can improve the process. However, “Man plans and God laughs.” We carefully fit together the pieces of the foundation like a puzzle, and it looks soooo right… until several stages later, when we find that we built the left side one row shorter than the right side. In quality terms, we have introduced a defect early in the process that was not discovered until late in the process. This is clearly a mistake. If we are sufficiently skilled, we can “go with the mistake” as in the quote above; otherwise, we go waayy back to correct it. Inventing Seated in your playspace, your goal ahead of you, your tools surrounding you, you begin to advance toward your goal. Making it up as you go, you address each obstacle as it occurs, just as if you are driving in the face of stop lights, pedestrians, traffic, and errant animals. You have far less advance planning at your disposal, but you have an end goal and a set of intermediate goals. Instead of the musical score on the left of the image, detailing every note and how it is to be played with copious amounts of ink, you have the sparse notation of chord, melody, and lyric on the right of the image. For each step of your journey, you are choosing the best actionsat the moment.You are hoping that a series of right choices, guided by experience over long time, will get you to your goal with reasonable efficiency. You are, in fact, performing dynamic optimization, solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a sequence of individual smaller problems. In an ideal situation, where predictions are accurate, unexpected events (late workers, tariff-constrained material shortages and the like) do not occur. In that ideal situation, end-to-end planning will likely yield a route that is more efficient than any route taken by stringing together a sequence of locally-optimum paths. After all, packing your suitcase by first laying everything out on the bed results in denser packing than fetching each item from its drawer and packing it as you remember it. But in the face of noise (unexpected events) occurring along the way, the dynamic optimization (“invention,” or “improvisation”) allows instant adaptation to obstacles, rather than slavishly following a plan despite unexpected events. Continuing our musical analogy, the right-hand image of the jazz lead sheet is played by inventing the particular voicing of each chord and playing the melody. Fundamental skills needed for the complete left-hand score include knowledge of the chords shown (C, D7, etc.), whether to play chords in the lower staff with melody in the upper hand or instead play the chords in inversions that place the melody on top, and how to smoothly transition, from one chord to the next, with minimal intervals between each chord tone (i.e., “voice leading”). “Noise” in this case can consist of the band leader unexpectedly telling you at the start of a repetition to take a solo, or your own discovery that the bass player is providing a strong bass line so that the piano does not need to, or that a singer is singing and your piano should not double her melody. Likewise, in giving a talk, you may have your bullet points at hand as reminders, but as you notice the audience beginning to snooze, you may improvise your presentation to become a bit more lively, using anything from speaking louder and with more energy (or pausing in silence) to walking around to skipping the particular section that is causing slumber. Neither of these examples of adaptive behavior — modifying either the music or the speech in response to conditions of the moment — is captured by the excruciating completeness of either a note-for-note musical score or a word-for-word written script. You are inventing. Making the shift Advancing from planned to improvised activity is aided by several factors: Achieving facilities with the tools of the endeavor, not only how but when to use each one; Gaining the confidence to quickly make small mistakes and immediately adapt (i.e., “going with the mistake rather than against it”); Obtaining rapid feedback, while the endeavor is still in progress and at that stage, of the results of your work (hearing the music as you play it, rather than at a playback session at the end of the work). All of these factors require experience with planned versions of the endeavor. To achieve facility with tools, one may memorize the actions of many scripted endeavors, to the point of being able to immediately recall and execute similar past patterns when faced with a real-time situation. It may be scales and chord voicings in music, such as the ii-V-I chord sequence that occurs in many keys. Gaining the confidence to make mistakes at low cost also comes with experience. A non-threatening audience for a talk, for example, may be developed by actually circulating through the audience and chatting with members before your presentation, so that you are presenting to Joe and Mary, not just to a faceless mass of people. Technology aids the obtaining of rapid feedback. No longer does one prepare a deck of IBM computer cards, hand them to the operator at a window, and wait while nibbling on fingernails while the computer program is run to see whether it crashed due to error on your part. Rarely now does one hand a document to a secretary for typing and receive it back for editing. Computers are programmed and run immediately on the desktop; writing is read immediately upon typing. How does one efficiently gain the experience required for transition from planning to invention? One may as well ask how to accelerate the acquisition of a year of experience. Methods include an experienced teacher, practice of fundamental exercises, and frequent “performances” of the task, whether it is music, rhetoric, or carpentry. This is a topic that I look forward to examining further. In short The adage of good planning is “Measure twice, cut once.” Perhaps the adage of good invention becomes “Measure once, cut once, repeat.” Maybe it is “fail early and adapt.”",John Ackenhusen,https://medium.com/@john_goodyear?source=post_page---byline--beedce3d8fbb---------------------------------------,0,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg,2021-01-15T21:06:41.696Z,Medium

https://medium.com/pcmag-access/how-to-make-your-android-phone-less-annoying-a5205ed8bbf6?source=tag_archive---------83-----------------------,How to Make Your Android Phone Less Annoying,Disable Bloatware,"PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share Android smartphones are great, but notifications and certain settings can make life more difficult than it has to be. Here are a few ways to optimize your device. ByEvan DashevskyandJason Cohen PCs, tablets, smartphones — even ourcoffee makers— can wirelessly connect to the internet at the push of a button, and devices buzz with emails, notifications, and status updates at all hours of the day. But it’s hard to imagine life without yourSamsung Galaxy Note 9orGoogle Pixel 3. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid some of these small irritations and make your day just a little bit calmer. Disable Bloatware Here are some facts that should be completely unrelated: 1) AT&T is my wireless carrier. 2) AT&T owns DirecTV. 3) I am not a DirectTV subscriber. However, a DirecTV remote app came pre-installed on my phone. And I can’t delete it. Welcome to the world ofbloatware. Bloatware is a blanket term used to describe pre-installed apps that take up space and resources on your phone. These apps — many of which you’ll never use — come courtesy of your phone’s manufacturer, carrier, and Google itself (plus a few licensed third-party apps thrown in for good measure). If you look through the apps on your phone, you’ll almost certainly find a bunch of apps you never downloaded and will never use. While bloatware is not unique to mobile devices, it’s most insidious on phones because of the limited computational resources, compared tothose on your home PC. Though most bloatware can be deleted, there are some apps that can’t go anywhere. By getting rid of what you can, they won’t tap into your phone’s background resources anymore. Long-press on the app icon to prompt the disable option. Alternatively, you can access individual app options by going to Settings > Apps and tapping on the app. Turn Off Auto Brightness Have you ever noticed your screen suddenly dimming or brightening all by itself? That’s auto brightness at work. This feature automatically adjusts your screen’s brightness depending on its environment. Basically, your phone screen will dim to complement the luminescence of a fancy candlelit dinner, but will brighten way up if you’re outside picnicking on a sunny day. Want to see it in action? If it’s on your device, cover up the light sensor on your phone for a few seconds (it’s usually on the top of the front-facing side of your device) and your screen should compensate accordingly. In theory, the feature is great. If you primarily use your phone in similarly lit indoor environments, then you might not even realize you have it. However, it tends to overcompensate a bit too much (and too suddenly) in either direction. Auto brightness is on by default on most Android systems. If you don’t have any problems with it, then let it be. However, if you’ve found it to be a bit jarring, you can turn it off by going to Settings > Display. In some versions of Android, this screen-brightness setting will be available in the pull-down shade (but more on that later). With auto brightness turned off, you can choose a static lighting setting to your liking and manually move as necessary (but keep in mind that a brighter screen burns up more juice). Enable Do Not Disturb Your phone is sure to notify you when someone comments on your latest Facebook post, likes your tweet, or emails you spam, but some information you don’t necessarily need waking you from your slumber at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday. Fortunately, Android provides a way out of this: Do Not Disturb. You can schedule Do Not Disturb via Settings > Sounds and vibration > Do not disturb. Here, you can tell your phone to forgo all notifications during a specific time, even phone calls. Of course, there will be notifications you’ll want at all hours of the day. Instead of flipping the switch, tap directly on Do not disturb to enter the feature’s settings menu. Here you can set up a recurring schedule for this mode, and you can even allow exceptions. In the Exceptions setting, you can always allows calls and messages from particular contacts (say, all those designated as “Favorites”), from “priority” apps, or even from callers who have repeatedly tried to reach you (the type of calls you get in an emergency situation). Manage Notifications If some apps are sending too many notifications, shut them off for that program. Maybe you’re getting annoying messages from social media apps, or perhaps thosegames you downloadedto your phone are a little too needy. Go to Settings > Notifications > and you can toggle all app notifications on/off or individually. Tap on a listed app to choose whether you want an entire notification card to pop up on your phone or not. Rearrange Pull-Down Buttons One of the best features on an Android phone is the pull-down shade (or notification shade). Simply slide your finger from the top of your screen down and you’ll find oft-used settings in nifty one-touch button form (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Location). And Android is nice enough to allow you to choose which icons are included in the shade for easy access. Perhaps you don’t really use things like Wi-Fi calling or NFC, but like having the ability to quickly set your phone to vibrate, toggle Location on/off, or access the flashlight — all with a single tap. You can rearrange which buttons appear in the shade by tapping the hamburger icon () in the top-right corner of the shade and tap the edit button. You can then move the buttons around to your liking. Customized Your Lock-Screen Settings Your Android phone offers several ways to protect your device. Requiring a password, fingerprint, or some other form of biometric authentication adds a small barrier between you and your digital world, but it’s worth it. Still, security and convenience don’t have to be enemies — for example, you can set your phone to not require a login for a set amount of time after it goes to sleep. Find the lock time that works for your lifestyle. Go to Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Secured lock time > choose the time that works for you. Alternatively, your phone may have a “Smart Lock” setting (nested under “Secure lock settings”), which keeps your phone unlocked when it registers you are in a “trusted” location (i.e. it can tell when it’s at your home via location services, or if it is connected to a trusted device like your car via Bluetooth). In this instance, you’ll also just have to trust the users around you. Don’t Use In-App Cameras Like to post selfies to Instagram or Snapchat? Sure, we all like to show off our fabulous new dos or that time we met that celebrity at that thing. You might have noticed that the in-app camera on these apps are kinda…lacking? If you’re not happy with the in-app camera your apps offer you, there is a very simple workaround. Take photos with your phone’s stock (and probably superior) photo app and upload to these social networks after the fact. Use Widgets Already! If you’re an Android user and you’re not taking advantage of widgets, you’re doing it wrong. Widgets are live app windows you can keep open on an individual home screen page. Many of the apps you will download also come with a widget that works in tandem with the program. If there is information you check often — email, weather, music,podcasts— you can just create a widget and fill up a portion of your home screen with it. Widgets make it a lot easier to access information — no need to open an app and swipe around for the info you’re looking for, because now it’s just always right there. To create a widget, long-press anywhere on any home screen page to prompt a series of options. Here, you’ll find the widgets link — tap that and you can swipe through a list of apps that have available widgets (not all apps do). Tap on any app widget and drag it into an open sector. Some widgets will come in different sizes and shapes to allow you options when fitting it onto your home screen. Get an External Bluetooth Speaker This tip is applicable to all mobile phone users: Get an external Bluetooth speaker. Some phones boast impressive speakers, but smartphone speakers (even top-of-the-line ones) can only achieve so much volume and bass. If you really want to fill a room, you’re going to need an external speaker. There are manyhigh-quality Bluetooth speakersyou can connect to your phone to listen to music, streaming radio, or podcasts while you perform other tasks around the house.

https://medium.com/@LazarusAlliance/the-6-most-common-cyber-security-mistakes-your-employees-are-making-40c0d21de081?source=tag_archive---------170-----------------------,The 6 Most Common Cyber Security Mistakes Your Employees Are Making,Written byLazarus_Alliance,"Lazarus_Alliance Follow -- Listen Share With an estimated90% of cyber attacks caused by human error or behavior, it’s important to understand the most common cyber security mistakes your employees are probably making and know how to mitigate them. Becoming victims of phishing schemes Stolen login credentials are the most common way hackers breach enterprise systems, and most of the time, these credentials are stolen through a phishing scheme. A highly targeted variant of phishing, calledspear phishing or business email compromise, is used to convince employees to wire money or send sensitive data, such as W2 information, to cyber criminals. Avoid having your employees make this cyber security mistake by educating them about the warning signs of a phishing scheme. Organizations must also establish policies against sending sensitive data through email, ensure that employees have access only to the systems and data they need to do their jobs, and add redundancy into payment approval processes, especially wire transfers. Mistakes involving login credentials This is a broad category of cyber security mistakes that includes: Using weak passwords Not usingmulti-factor authenticationwhenever possible Reusing passwords Sharing login credentials Writing credentials down and leaving them in public areas, such as sticky notes in the work area Leaving a terminal unattended without logging out first Most of these security mistakes can be avoided through employee education on the dangers of not keeping login credentials secure. Organizations can also employ technical measures to force login sessions to automatically time out when a terminal is inactive, require the use of MFA, and automatically generate strong passwords. Using shadow IT software and services Over three-quarters of employeesadmit to using shadow IT softwareand services at the workplace. Most of the time, their intentions are not malicious. They are simply trying to do their jobs better, and they do not realize how dangerous shadow IT can be to security and compliance. Employee education is the best way to head off this security mistake. Technical tools can also be employed to ferret out shadow IT apps. Inserting “mystery” devices into workplace computers A commonsocial engineeringtactic is for hackers to leave USB thumb drives and other plugin devices in public areas where employees will find them. Sometimes, the devices will have labels meant to entice employees to want to covertly access them, such as “Q4 Performance Reviews” or indicating that the device contains pornographic content. Employees must be educated about the dangers of making this security mistake. Making security mistakes when using public WiFi Free public WiFi networks are ubiquitous, found everywhere from fast-food restaurants to aboard trains. Remote workers and employees who frequently travel for business often take advantage of public WiFi to work on the go. As with shadow IT apps, this is usually because of a security mistake, not maliciousness or negligence; employees don’t realize how dangerous public WiFi is. In addition to educating employees onbest practices when accessing public WiFi networks, organizations should provide VPN access to all employees who work remotely. Not protecting computers and other IoT devices This security mistake involves physical protection as well as password protection. In a recent survey,over half of working adultsadmitted to allowing friends and family to access devices given to them by their employers. Employees who travel for work may also leave devices unattended in public areas or hotel rooms or allow strangers to “borrow” their smart phones. Employees who travel need to be educated aboutbest cyber practices when traveling. Organizations should ensure that these employees’ devices are protected with strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, or a biometric lock. If possible, have disposable phones and laptops on hand to loan to employees for travel purposes. If an employee must travel with a device that contains sensitive data, make sure the device is encrypted.

Justin Kan’s career blew up in the mid-2000s when he started livestreaming himself 24/7 on Justin.tv, a Y Combinator backed startup that he co-founded. Justin.tv eventually turned into Twitch and sold to Amazon for nearly a billion dollars. He has gone on to found multiple startups since then, includingExec,Whale, and nowAtrium. Raniduhas a unique background. Before jumping into tech, he rose to fame as an R&B and hip-hop artist (check him outhere). He went on to join Google before founding the first of many startups, many of which have been centered around his passion for music. We talk about a few of them includingThe Drop,The Artist Union, andAudius, a decentralized audio distribution platform he started earlier this year. In this episode we talk about: What they’ve learned from building products and startups, what lessons they would give to entrepreneurs starting out today, and how the startup and investing landscape has changed. Justin explains why he says that 2010–2013 was the “sweet spot” for building and scaling a company in the Bay Area. We talk about whether distributed teams make sense due to the escalating cost of living and the battle for talent in San Francisco. Whether an Apple Watch can replace your smartphone. Justin talks about how he survives in Silicon Valley without a phone, how going phone-free has changed how he works and lives and why he compares compulsive smartphone use to an addiction. He says a smartphone is a “Juul for your mind.” We’re all big music fans, so we also talk about artists we’ve been loving recently, why the lines between music genres are being blurred, and the economics of creating music for artists. We also discuss some of their favorite products including a gratitude journal app that will improve your mental health, a “social network for athletes,” and a tool to help organize your tasks at work. We’ll be back next week so be sure to subscribe onApple Podcasts,Google Podcasts,Spotify,Breaker,Overcast, or wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts. Also, big thanks to our sponsors,GE Ventures,Rally Rd, andAngelListfor their support. 😸 “We [at Atrium] have some resources, [we] have expanded, but measuring your company’s success in headcount is like measuring an airplane in weight, so it’s not exactly the right measure of success.” — Justin“As an independent artist today, it takes between three months and eighteen months between the time you stream my music to get paid, and we [at his new company Audius] think that’s wrong in 2018.” — Ranidu“I think the sweet spot [to build a company in the Bay Area] was in 2010 through 2013 or so, where the costs were relatively much lower on the startup salary side.

We gained valuable insight into marine conservation research and projects which brought fresh perspectives on how Last of Ours can bring fun and awareness to the masses to help protect wildlife and restore their habitats! Here are some highlights from our trip as well as the projects we had the pleasure of learning from. 🏝 The inauguralRotto Tech Festwas a full day onRottnest Islanddedicated to marine conservation and how technology is being used to collect, analyze, and interpret data. AsLast of Ourswill be referring to real-world data for our NFT species count and impact tracking, we were extremely excited to see the innovative techniques that researchers and engineers have come up with to study how we can best protect our planet’s marine species. 🧬 Detecting life with environmental DNA Did you know that columns of seawater contain valuable information about the species have passed through there? As marine animals move through the water, they leave a piece of their DNA behind via skin cells, scales, hair, excrement… you name it. Scientists have found a way to extract this DNA from water samples to analyze which species had been there. The DNA isolated and characterised from sediments and water is calledenvironmental DNA. eDNA can give us a glimpse of biodiversity, food web dynamics, diet analysis and invasive species monitoring. 🔬 First described in 2012, the use of eDNA in water was demonstrated as an example to characterise vertebrates living in the sample. Since then, numerous studies have emerged to investigate the potential of this approach inbiosecurityandbiodiversity assessments.MetabarcodingeDNA has become feasible thanks to the ability to simultaneously sequence millions of copies of DNA from complex multi-species environmental samples. Professor Mike Bunce, head ofthe Trace and environmental DNA (TrEnD) laboratorypresented his lab’s work at Rottnest to showcase the strides they have made thanks to this technique. They also have a partner program with other research labs to integrate baited remote underwater video (BRUV) technologies and eDNA as a cutting-edge tool to give us insights into how we can best manage various marine ecosystems. 💙 Building communities for ocean conservation withHope Spots Led by legendary oceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earle,Mission Blueis building a global coalition to boost public awareness, access and support for a worldwide network of marine protected areas calledHope Spots. Individuals and communities around the world can nominate marine sites which have: Special abundance or diversity of species, unusual or representative species, habitats or ecosystems Particular populations of rare, threatened or endemic species Potential to reverse damage from negative human impacts The presence of natural processes such as major migration corridors or spawning grounds Significant historical, cultural or spiritual values Particular economic importance to the community We heard from the founder of theHealing Lesvosproject, whose Hope Spot atAvlakiseeks to reverse the negative impact on marine life caused by plastic litter and other marine waste during the height of the European humanitarian crisis, as well as protect the extensive coastlines and marine ecosystemsthat coexist with abundant commercial, fishing, and shipping activities in the region. Avlaki is home to assemblages of aquatic birds, marine mammals and magnificent reefs in a vibrant volcanic environment. Chosen for its abundance of migratory species, significant historical-cultural value and economic importance to the community, theAvlaki Hope Spothas the potential to reverse the negative impact caused by humans and through ecotourism, a nascent but growing economic driver in the region. The hope is to formalize the area as a dive park to contribute to sustainable development and give locals alternative ways to seek income and enhance their quality of life. A thriving dive park will allow divers to not only view beautiful marine life but also assist with restoring the sea basin. The dive park could catalyze the creation of a formal Greek Marine Protected Area at Avlaki, sustaining a healthy ecosystem for Mediterranean marine life. The EU has already designated several areas in the vicinity through theirNatura 2000conservation program. Mission Blue implements campaigns that put Hope Spots on the world stage through documentaries, social media, and technologies like Google Earth. It also supports conservation NGOs around the world that share the mission of building public support for ocean protection. What will be crucial is the coming together of communities on the ground to help spread the message, educate, and reinforce formal efforts to protect and restore their local marine ecosystems. 🐟 Counting fish with baited underwater cameras After the conference, ProfessorJessica Meeuwigwas kind enough to give us a tour of her lab, theCentre for Marine Futures,and a behind-the-scenes look into her team’s work —studying the effectiveness of marine parks in the open ocean. 🌊Decades of research from the Great Barrier Reef, New Zealand, and Europe have shown that the establishment of marine parks in coastal areas has resulted in more fish andbiggerfish, benefiting tourism and fisheries alike. But if we wanted to extend marine parks to the open ocean, how do we measure its effectiveness in the big blue? To answer this question, they use a baited remote underwater videography (BRUV) device to attract and record footage of marine life in a body of water. The rig is composed of a metal frame attached to a bait-filled canister, along with two GoPros which capture footage of anything swimming by. Professor Meeuwig’s team at the University of Western Australia analyzes thousands of hours of this footage from oceans around the world. This data gives us a glimpse into species diversity, abundance, behaviour and fish measurements accurateto the millimetre! From this, we can look at the outcomes of ocean protection and interpret it with other samples such as acoustics and eDNA to gain a deeper understanding of our marine ecosystems. Beyond this, the Center for Marine Futures is exploring questions such as: 💙 How do pelagic sharks and fishes respond to the establishment of large marine reserves? 🦈 What roles doapex predators(those at the top of the food chain) play in tropical marine ecosystems? ☀️How is doesclimate variabilityaffect fish growth, and what does this mean for warming oceans? 📈How are sharks and fishes distributedon biogeographical scales and in relation to habitat? 🎣 What are thesocioeconomic drivers of illegal fishing? An example of BRUV footage from the lab: We are extremely grateful to Jessica and her team for taking the time to walk us through the process of equipment design, footage collection, and sifting through videos and identifying various species. The implications of this data will give insight into the effectiveness of marine protected areas and can back legislative efforts to establish MPAs in the open ocean. Onwards 🚀 What a way to end 2018! — quokka selfies, diving with rays, turtle watching, and conversations with the best minds in the space about how we can put our innovative powers to add momentum to wildlife conservation efforts. We were extremely humbled by the excitement and feedback we received from the tech and conservation community in Australia about Last of Ours, and hope that the project can soon channel the attention, energy, and funding to help these teams on the ground make strides in the important work they do. Beyond the trip, the team has been busy at work with product development, partnership engagements, and seeding the community that will play an important role moving forward in building public momentum for Last of Ours. We would like to invite not only the blockchain and conservation communities to join us in our adventures, but also the general public whose curiosities and daily activities are instrumental in driving the lasting changes that we want to see. 🌎 We are full steam ahead in 2019 and look forward to sharing both our progressandthe work that scientists, NGOs, conservationists, and local communities are doing to protect and restore life Planet Earth! Our next stop is Las Vegas for Sir Richard Branson’sExtreme Tech Challengesemi-finals. Catch us at our CES booth on January 10th! 💬 Join the community and stay tuned for updates onFacebook,Telegram,Twitter,Instagram, ourwebsiteand of course here onMedium. Until next time! Last of Ours is bringing people together to protect our planet’s endangered species and natural zones by creating shared value between social entertainment and real-world impact. Using the latest real-world wildlife population estimates, Living Animal Social Tokens (LAST) are created as digital representations of individual animals and distributed for use in social entertainment applications and games. Every unique token represents a real endangered animal living in the wild, one-to-one. The tokens are collectable, tradable, and playable in various games (mobile, AR, VR). Users are passively contributing to conservation & reforestation projects solely by participating in this entertainment ecosystem and may also actively allocate where their donations go on a transparent Kickstarter-like platform which will give visibility into the impact they have created. We are on a mission to create awareness and engagement for everyone to help protect the Last of Ours.🦏",Nichanan Kesonpat,https://medium.com/@nichanank?source=post_page---byline--e075aacfd8c---------------------------------------,15,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg,2019-01-03T07:48:47.059Z,Medium
https://medium.com/hackernoon/weather-sat-9620228789c8?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,How to Download Live Images From Government Weather Satellites,The Theory,"Member-only story Alex Wulff Follow -- Share Using nothing but your computer, some software, and a $20 radio dongle you can receive transmissions from NOAA weather satellites in the sky overhead. This is an incredibly exciting project that’s easy to do but produces great images. Think about it — you can receive images from a satellite almost 1000KM straight above you! The Theory NOAA operates a series of weather satellites, designated NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19, that circle the Earth in polar orbits. These satellites are particularly interesting because they’re constantly transmitting an easy-to-decode image signal of what they’re currently looking at. The satellites’ orbits are configured such that one of the three passes within almost every point on the globe every three hours. You can track each of the threehere. The closer the yellow line is to your location when the satellite is overhead the higher the satellite will appear in the sky. Keep in mind that the satellites’ trajectories across the globe (the yellow lines) are constantly progressing sideways by a few hundred miles with each successive orbit. You don’t really need to worry about tracking…",Alex Wulff,,189,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*OZJgVybjI19AlSIw3KgAFQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*OZJgVybjI19AlSIw3KgAFQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*OZJgVybjI19AlSIw3KgAFQ.jpeg,2020-05-01T14:36:49.997Z,Medium

https://medium.com/coinmonks/caching-ethereum-events-with-mysql-18bfa3558355?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,Caching Ethereum events with MySQL,Published inCoinmonks,"Oleg Kondrakhanov Follow Coinmonks -- 5 Listen Share In this article, I am going to demonstrate a simple approach to caching Ethereum events. Here I won’t describe what events are as there are a lot of articles covering that topic (here is the perfect one). I’ll just say that typically we use events for some off-chain operations, for examples tracking token’s transfers or retrieving the filtered list of particular transactions, just like a good old SQL query. Let’s suppose we want to make a website that tracks some token transfers, a kind of Etherscan. We definitely need such simple operations like: get all the token transfers get transfers made from particular Ethereum address get transfers made to particular Ethereum address get transfers that are above or below a particular amount get transfers within particular time frames What we have in web3 now isgetPastEventsmethod, the example usage of which is The main issue with this approach is it can be slow as blockchain grows, especially if you don’t run your own Ethereum node and use public providers like Infura or MyEtherApi. The next thing — it is almost impossible to implement some tricky queries as filter object’s functionality is quite limited. Besides, events already written to the blockchain can’t be changed, only new records can be added with time. This and other facts make events a perfect target for caching. In this example, we’ll use MySQL as a database for holding our event records. MySQL has capabilities to store raw JSON and then compose queries using that JSON object’s properties as if they were usual SQL columns. Let’s take a closer look at the result ofgetPastEventsmethod to realize what data we work with. I took some Binance coin transfers as an example. Each event object has the following structure: As you can see, the event arguments are stored inreturnValuesproperty.blockNumber,transactionHash,logIndexmight be useful too as I’ll show you later. Our goal is to write those JSON objects to the database and to implement easy access methods that can replace standard web3’sgetPastEventsmethod seamlessly. Here is the SQL script for creating theTransfertable. Some important things to explain: jsoncolumn is created as JSON type. This allows us to create auto-generated columns using special syntax from,to,value— these are auto-generated columns. The expression could seem complex at first, but it is really simple in fact. For example,fromcolumn value equals toreturnValues.fromproperty of the object stored injsoncolumn. txHashandlogIndex. Combined together these properties identify every event object. We need those to make the unique index for a row, thus preventing occasional duplication of events. Optionally we could also add database index for increasing the performance. For example, for thetocolumn Node.js. I use version 8.4.0. Web3 npm package to interact with the blockchain. We need specific version 1.0.0-beta.35. The usage of latest version beta.36 resulted in the ‘Returned values aren’t valid, did it run Out of Gas’ error when trying to retrieve some events. 3. To work with MySQL database in JavaScript we should installmysqlpackage 4. And the last — MySQL server. It is worth mentioning that we’ll use MySQL 5.7 as the latest 8.0 version doesn’t seem to be compatible with themysqlpackage (it gave me strange error ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE while trying to connect). We’ll utilize connection pool to make queries for this example. It would be more convenient to use a promisified version ofquerymethod Now we can use the following code to insert a record into thetransfertable created before. Here we also check for possible duplicate rows insertion. Now we don’t want to do anything special in that case, probably we’ve already written those duplicate events earlier or something like this. So we just consider this kind of exceptions handled. Let’s construct a contract object to retrieve events from. We can include onlyTransferevent interface in theabiparameter, like this: This is the base version of the caching function. First, we get event objects, then write them to the database, one by one. Now let’s expand this to a simple background script that constantly scans blockchain for the events emitted. Some utility functions The first one is simpleasync/awaitimplementation ofsetTimeout. The second one serves for infinite periodic calls offn— the worker function. With these helper functions, our background scanner looks quite simple Let me explain that ‘latestEthBlock + 1’ thing. Web3’sgetPastEvents(fromBlock, toBlock)returns events written within that[from, to]range, including the borders. So without this incrementing the nextcacheEventscall will again return the events written intolatestEthBlockas a part of the result. Though duplicate events won’t be inserted into database due to unique index implemented, we still don’t want this excess work to be done. This implementation should be pretty much enough for a simple background scanner. However, there is always room for improvement. We’ll return to it a bit later. Now let’s take a quick look at what we can do now with that data. Here is an example of the function to select transfers made from a particular address We query the database using the generatedfromcolumn. The most notable part here is that the result of the function looks just like the result of web3’sgetPastEvents. It makes refactoring the current code a lot easier. The event object contains a lot of properties that might be totally useless for your application. It would be better to remove the excess before writing to the database. That way we are saving a lot of space. As you might also have noticed, the current version of the scanner begins with block #0 each time it is restarted. While scanning all the way to current block it will try to insert duplicate records into the database. We can eliminate that excess work by querying the database for the latest cached block. It would be also nice to start scanning not from the block #0, but at least from the block when the contract was deployed. For simplicity, you might get this information usingetherscan.io. Here we again use MySQL json functions to get theblockNumberproperty of the event object. Then replace the old piece of thescanfunction with the new one Finally, we’ve created a simple but working event scanner that continuously caches events into MySQL database. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I’ll try to answer. Complete source code is available herehttps://github.com/olekon/p1_eth_caching.

https://medium.com/world-of-opportunity/securing-land-tenure-with-smartphones-fe38e2a179e2?source=tag_archive---------85-----------------------,Securing land tenure with smartphones,ByLinus Pott,"ByLinus Pott World Bank Follow World of Opportunity -- 1 Listen Share More than 1,000 years. That’s how long recent estimates suggest it would take in some developing countries to legally register all land — due to the limited number of land surveyors in country and the use of outdated, cumbersome, costly, and overly regulated surveying and registration procedures. But I am convinced that the target of registering all land can be achieved — faster and cheaper. This is an urgent need in Africa whereless than 10% of all landis surveyed and registered, as this impacts securing land tenure rights for both women and men — a move that canhave a greater effecton household income, food security, and equity. The question remains, how can we register land and secure tenure at scale?Perhaps one of our answers can be found in rural Tanzania where I recently witnessed the use of a mobile surveying and registration application. In several villages, USAID and the government of Tanzania are piloting the use of theMobile Application to Secure Tenure(MAST), one of several (open-source) applications available on the market. DFID, SIDA, and DANIDA are supporting a similar project. The process of mobile land surveying and registration goes like this: A standard tablet or smartphone connected to a GPS receiver is used. In the presence of land rights holders and neighbors, community members are trained to use the application to record individual and communal land boundary and ownership information. Afterwards, a public display period for objection and correction is carried out to ascertain consensus. The data is automatically stored in a database once the device gains internet access — and when this is finally approved by government authorities. Technology truly reduces the barriers to entry as it enables the participation of all community members– from the initial informational meeting to the confirmation of boundaries with neighbors, or as part of the team handling the application. Perhaps what was even more encouraging was the inclusion of youths and women in the teams, as they are often not given access to land and participation in land-related discussions in patriarchal societies and customary contexts. Using mobile solutions is not only participatory, it is also cheap and fast. Analysis shows that MAST has brought down the costs for issuing a Customary Certificate of Right of Occupancy, the legal certificate of securing tenure for customary land in rural Tanzania, toless than $10. While these costs exclude satellite imagery and technical assistance, they are still an indicator of how cheap mass registration can get. While the technology isfit-for-purpose, a common concern is related to the lower accuracy of boundary demarcation conducted with mobile devices. However, in rural areas, surveying accuracies at the centimeter level are not always required, and a general boundary approach can be applied, since tenure security does not necessarily increase as the accuracy increases. Furthermore, new innovations, such asexternal antennasorsmartphoneswith dual-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System receivers can be used for mobile boundary demarcation, which will continue to increase accuracy. So how can we scale up these innovative technologies? As part of the World Bank’sTanzania Land Tenure Improvement Project, a key activity will be to scale up the issuance of land certificates in rural areas. This will be the first time such technology is used on a large scale in Africa, and the lessons learned will be useful for other African countries embarking on land administration reforms supported by the World Bank —Cote d’Ivoire,Ghana,Liberia, andMozambique. It should also be noted that the usefulness of the technology depends on the context. In some cases, using the technology might require amendments of laws or regulations. And we are still exploring the question of how to adapt it to high-density urban areas. Of course, technology is not the silver bullet for securing land tenure. It is very important to raise awareness of landholders on the processes and benefits of participation in the process and registration. Therefore, we need to create incentives for landholders to participate in land registration activities and make land certificates a desirable asset — for example, by linking them to access to (micro-)finance or agricultural inputs, developing alternative land dispute resolution mechanisms, and exploring innovative models for landholders to participate directly in negotiations with potential investors. Also, land information systems and the geospatial infrastructure as well as policy and legal reform will be necessary for a systemic approach. Capacities to manage such reforms to secure tenure at scale are necessary as well. Despite the caveats, I think that we are at a point in history where the recording of land rights is cheaper, faster, and more inclusive than ever before. Positively disruptive, don’t you think?

https://medium.com/@levihpatton/designing-with-the-2018-ipad-pro-1971f2157d00?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,Designing With the 2018 iPad Pro,Written byLevi Patton,"Levi Patton Follow -- 3 Listen Share I’ll be to the first to admit that I’m kind of impulsive. And while picking up a new 11-inch iPad Pro definitely qualifies as an impulse purchase, it’s impressive utility as a design tool has more than compensated for some of the post-impulse-purchase guilt. Until now, I’ve never owned an iPad or ever really had the need or desire to own one. So when I picked up the 2nd generation Apple Pencil and started doodling on one of the new iPads to kill time in the Apple Store, my expectations were pretty flat. It was another super pretty piece of Apple glass with a $120 stylus. Oh, it costs another $200 to add on the ‘smart’ keyboard? Classic Apple play. Fun to mess around with on an Apple Store errand, but not something I’d actually consider shelling out for. I sketched a couple quick figures, some portraits, and other random doodles. Whoa, this thing was pretty sleek. The interaction between the pen and the screen was impressively smooth. The sensitivity of the stylus captured my sketchy/messy drawing style surprisingly well. I’ve always loved drawing with pen and paper, but have never really transferred over to digital mediums because you tend to lose that organic feel and style. Not the case with this magic little slate. Then I tried sketching out a couple basic wireframe shapes. I drew a crooked box that I didn’t like, so I double tapped the pen to bring up the eraser in a seamless and intuitive motion, corrected the mistake, and continued on with the sketches. Uh oh. I was officially delighted. Needless to say, I went home with the iPad with the insurance of an extended holiday return policy. I had a month and a half (instead of the usual two weeks) to explore and decide if it was worth the hefty price tag. Pack your bags Frodo, this was going to be a journey. For the next couple of weeks, I explored a huge range of design-oriented apps to put the iPad to the test. Right off the bat, it became clear that some of the most impressive apps (unsurprisingly) belong to the Adobe family. Adobe Capture Adobe Comp Adobe Draw Adobe Sketch Spark Post Each of these has its own impressive utility for illustrating and designing. They’re free and integrate with each other really nicely. For instance, you can useAdobe Captureto snap a picture and quickly generate a palette based on the colors in the image and export it to your color library inAdobe Sketch. Adobe Compworks as a quick and efficient wireframing tool for easily creating low to mid-fidelity wireframes: Adobe DrawandAdobe Sketchare both killer apps for drawing and painting. You have a ton of control over your brush tools and pallet; and, there are intuitive finger gestures for undoing and redoing strokes and controlling the canvas. Something else I’ve encountered in working on illustrations and designs with the iPad is how it has fundamentally changed my approach in the creative process. For instance, when I paint with oils, oftentimes I’ll have an idea for adding some shading or accents on a certain part of the painting. If I execute the idea and I end up not liking the result, I can sometimes undo the effect with more paint—at the expense of lost time—but it often ends up completely changing the feel of the painting. This creates a kind of risk/reward dynamic that directly influences decisions when drawing or painting. I’ll often end up being more conservative at the expense of experimenting on a potentially cool effect. Painting, sketching, or designing on the iPad is a distinct experience in the sense that nothing feels permanent. The shortcuts and gestures for ‘undoing’ are seamlessly integrated into your workflow, and it encourages experimentation without fear of repercussion or lost time. This is true for painting and illustration, but also when sketching out wireframes or designing infographics. The ability to move, merge, change, and rearrange so fluidly makes designing on the 2018 iPad Pro an absolute delight. With the cutoff for return quickly approaching, I think this impulse purchase has earned its permanent place in my quiver of design tools; and, it will be an awesome asset for creativity and design moving into 2019.",Levi Patton,https://medium.com/@levihpatton?source=post_page---byline--1971f2157d00---------------------------------------,772,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg,2019-01-02T20:00:01.046Z,Medium

But, your controller can definitely hold you back — nobody wants to playDr. Mariowith a computer keyboard, after all. Even if you have a controller with the correct layout, subtle differences in button feel can completely ruin the experience. But if you have a Game Boy,you can now use it as a wireless controller thanks to this special cartridge. The Wireless Gameboy Controller Device is a cartridge that’s compatible with the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance, and the Advance SP. It’ll turn your Game Boy of choice into a wireless controller that works with a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a GameCube. That means you canplay a gamelikePokémon RedorBluethrough RetroPie running ona Raspberry Pi, while using an actual Game Boy Color as the controller! The cartridge works by making your Game Boy think you’re playing an actual game. There’s nothing on the Game Boy’s screen, but the “game” still accepts all of the button inputs. Every 2ms, it checks for a button press, and sends those button presses to a wireless receiver plugged into your computer or Raspberry Pi. The receiver refreshes every 8ms, so there shouldn’t be any noticeable input lag. Simply put, it’s a streamlined solution for your using your Game Boy as a wireless controller.

Cook,"Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share As spotted on Reddit, the creator of this perfboard clock notes that one can lose track of time when working at your computer for extended hours. While thereisnormally a little clock in one corner of your screen, more than likely you fail to look at it, and whenever your eyes wander off-screen to — you know, stare off into space — that little clock is nowhere to be found in your line of sight. To help with this very modern problem, theTime ‘O’ Time clock was designedusing six 8-segment bubble display modules, vaguely reminiscent of miniature Nixie tubes. The assembly is creatively soldered on a pair of perfboards, sandwiched together via header pins that allow for disassembly as needed. Power is supplied through the USB port of a laptop computer when used as intended, although any USB power source would also suffice. When disconnected, time is preserved using a CR3032 battery, so it doesn’t have to be reset ever time it’s plugged in. An ATmega 8L chip controls the clock, which keeps track of time using an internal oscillator.

But, while they can range in price anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, a large percentage use the same controller chips. Timo Birnschein’s Acton Blink Qu4tro is a fairly high end model, but that controller meant the remote was still frustrating to use. So,Birnschein designed his own open source remote. Birnschein’s Open esk8 Remote works with anyelectric skateboardthat uses the nRF24L01+ chip for wireless communication — which is probably most of them. It addresses many of the frustrations found in OEM remotes included with these mass-produced electric skateboards, including better battery life indicators, improved throttle control, and more consistent communication. It also feels a lot more solid, which is an important consideration for a device like this. Inside Birnschein’s remote isan Arduino Nano, an nRF24L01+ breakout board, a DC/DC converter board, a throttle potentiometer, a power switch, LEDs, micro switches, a buzzer, and 2 AAA batteries. To build this, you’ll needa 3D printerfor the body of the remote. To make the PCB you’ll need a small mill, or you can simply send the design out for professional fabrication. Thanks to Birnschein’s hard work reverse-engineering the NRF24L01+’s wireless communication protocol, you can build your own remote that works much better than the one that came with your electric skateboard.",Cameron Coward,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward?source=post_page---byline--45adc4a94ccd---------------------------------------,1,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg,2019-01-04T18:38:53.256Z,Medium
https://medium.com/coinmonks/electrify-me-the-lightning-network-f2aad299e9b3?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,Electrify Me: The Lightning Network,2018 achievements…,"Digital Doppelgangers Follow Coinmonks -- 4 Listen Share The lightning network seems to be the answer to all Bitcoin and blockchain related ills: the ideal alternative to the clogged, clumped, over-crowded payment processing ecosystem we’re currently saddled with, with its slow speed, high transaction fees and all-around, ever pervading inefficiency. Surely, with Bitcoin being the natural evolution of currency (and by extension, humanity itself), improved levels of usability should freely follow in its wake — however, as is often the case within the launch of new technologies, the final infrastructure does tend to lag several steps (or miles) behind. With Visa able to process 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash 61 and Bitcoin a mere 7 transactions per second, its inadequacy is glaringly obvious to all members of the crypto community. The lightning network grew into prominence during the more nascent architectural days of 2017, before its official, full-blooded incarnation in March 2018. Since then, particularly in recent months, it has travelled swiftly from strength to strength. One of the key players — and early adopters — within the lightning network space is Bitfury. Bitfury is “one of the largest full-service blockchain technology companies in the world”, providing both software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals to securely transfer assets across the blockchain network. Interestingly, Bitfury have been the first to fully implement a lightning-network based coffee-purchasing system. Their lightning network engineering team, known as LightningPeach, partnered with payments startup Paytomat in order to launch the lightning network via their platform — an all-around successful integration, garnering further faith in the Lightning Network, and pushing Paytomat up the rankings of revolutionary retribution platforms. 2018 achievements… Lightning Labs, the infamous proponents of the Lightning Network, have achieved a significant amount over the past year: regardless of Bitcoin’s dips, its ability to travel sideways, upside down and fling itself askance in every other direction, the lightning network itself has gone from strength to strength, unfazed by market volatility. November saw the network top 4,000 nodes and before burgeoning to uphold over $2 million value of bitcoin, its capacity continuing to rise after the spiral of BTC, experiencing an increase of almost 300%. Yes, it’s still possible to remain profitable during a stark, bleak crypto midwinter. For instance, the number of crypto ATMs around the world kept growing steadily, with 209 machines opening around the world in December. Canadian BTC mining company Hut 8 claimed a record high $13.5 million for Q3 2018, and Japanese IT giant GMO reported that its crypto businesses, including mining equipment production and its crypto exchange, gained 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) during the same period (although some fraudulent dabbling may have been involved). Open Node, a well-seasoned, dynamic member of the lightning network conglomerate, has begun to painstakingly facilitate the launch of the ideal bitcoin payment processing system, negotiating its widespread acceptance with as many merchants as possible, including Starbucks and Tesla, according to Tim Draper’s excited tweet last month. OpenNode charge a transaction fee of 1%: as far as revenue generation goes, it’s hardly outlandish, particularly when stacked beside a successful, all-encompassing payment network. Top Lightning Network Users of Q4, 2018: Bitrefill:A website specialized in providing top-ups for cell phone lines and various gift cards. Blockstream:A blockchain company dedicated to the development of applications on bitcoin, especially sidechains. Its best-known innovation is Liquid HodlMonkey:a company dedicated to selling clothes with crypto-related designs TorGuard VPN:Company specializing in cybersecurity and VPN service provisioning Living Room of Satoshi:Australian company focused on providing options for the payment of various invoices with cryptocurrencies. So... how does it work? The lightning network's mechanism utilizes the relatively young Distributed Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol, which allows separation of the voting power and block production, with no risks of a hard fork. The BTC Lightning Network, a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of the BTC blockchain, aims to solve the problems with scalability through the use of additional, separate payment channels — a secure and fast way to carry out transactions between a number of users without the necessity of recording them on the blockchain — until the moment the channel is closed. (You certainly can’t avoid it altogether, of course.) These off-chain payment channels facilitate instantaneous micropayments, and a greater, augmented performance for public blockchains. (We’ll expand onto private blockchains shortly.) According to Jack Zhang, “Pow and PoS are easily centralized, while DPoS represents true decentralization. Moreover, DPoS has the benefit of high efficiency, with little resource consumption”.If we’re to engage in a PoW, PoS and DPoS debate, first we need to establish the facts. DDoS vs. PoW vs. PoS Distributed proof of stake, alongside Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The latter two are older, more wearied and time-worn hats, squabbled over copiously during the evolution of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. All three fall beneath the umbrella of consensus mechanisms, which the blockchain/cryptocurrency sphere relies upon — the oxygen of the industry, so to speak. Cryptocurrency, of course, uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information, as opposed to a centralised authority, such as a government or a central bank. In the welcome absence of this entity, it is necessary to rely upon an alternative: the consensus mechanisms, all of which borrow certain components freely from one another. All consensus mechanisms work to achieve one, unanimous goal: make it difficult to attack this network, and profitable to protect it. Achievable — yes. Simple? No. PoW Everyone’s favourite — the sanctified system powering Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Miners endeavour to solve a cryptographic puzzle, consisting of the mathematical function (hash). The first mining pool forming a hash with specific properties are remunerated with a few Bitcoins, at estimated 10 minute installments. This acts as proof: they have completed the work required to verify all transactions in a block as valid — the product of their labours is then added to the blockchain. Cons: not energy efficient and lacking in environmental friendliness and adequate sustainability. With PoW, organizations that can afford faster and more powerful processing power usually have a better chance of getting the reward than the others — leading to a more unfair distribution of wealth, which Bitcoin itself was designed to tackle. PoS Ethereum’s considering making a well-timed move over to this one. Why? Because it doesn’t need computers in order to perform repetitive computations, thus presenting itself as a more environmentally friendly, sustainable alternative. PoS replaces miners with validators, in a certain situation wherein they will lock up some of their coins as stake — or a deposit. A group of validators takes turns proposing and voting on the next block; the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its stake. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will receive a reward in proportion to their bets — we hope. Anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency can become a validator by sending a specific type of transaction to lock up their fund within firm lacerations of security. Also, rewards for the creation of a new block are different: with Proof-of-Work, the miner may potentially own none of the digital currency he/she is mining. In PoS, forgers are always those who own the coins minted — thus drastically reducing the risk of fraud. DDoS Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a more efficient form of PoS. DPoS uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. Community members vote for “super representatives” to secure their network — these super representatives (very aptly named) will be rewarded by validating transactions for the next block. Better? Yes. As the DPoS vote is consistently on-going, if a super representative does not comply with regulations or perform well, people in the community can remove their votes, essentially firing the bad representative — they are rendered useless. The super representative must obey all rules and keep the network uptime as high as possible, or face the guillotine: a swift, violent rebuttal from its community members. And the best part? It’s a democratic system. Instead of relying on processing power from a centralized authority, bad actors will lose their position and power within the network, at the network members’ behest. These members will maintain the decentralized architecture of the network, as well as benefiting from its speed and agility. The Power of Micropayments As we’re all aware, the power of micropayments is undisputed. Efficiency is the most mandatory component of a financial ecosystem — and mciryopayments can serve as the missing flame, with the lightning network serving as much needed paraffin. “CryptoGraffitti”, the illusory, as yet unidentified crypto and fintech based artist, following the successful auctioning of a micro-painting depicting a black swan, released a statement extolling the many virtues of a future where “micropayments are omnipresent. Artists paid by the view…writers by the poem…musicians by the listen.”An almost intoxicatingly attractive proposal for any independent content creator — and an achievable goal as well. In recent news… Roger Ver strikes again with what is arguably a barrage of insensitivity, ruthlessly preaching the virtues of Bitcoin Cash, far worthier of the prowess of the lightning network in comparison to its lowly sibling — Bitcoin. Open Node, a prolific lightning network company, has soundly rejected 2.5 million dollars from Roger Ver, to build a protocol on Bitcoin Cash. According to Open Node: “our vision of a better, more open financial system is only possible with Bitcoin.” Cue the sighs of relief from the old religion, crucifix-bearing, holy-water swigging portion of our crypto society, otherwise known as the “HODLers” or “Maximalists”. Bitcoin continues to reign supreme in our hearts and minds.⠀A return of the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash wars of the past several months? Or another instalment in the battle of investor upon investor? Roger Ver appears reluctant to take on Tim Draper, the principal investor in Open Node, although he remains sceptical of his reluctance to combine BCH with the lightning network. According to Ver: “the Lightning Network would work far, far, far, far better on a system that doesn’t have a limit to the size of the blocks, (like Bitcoin Cash) than it will on BTC.” Point taken — the four “very”s really added some much needed oomph. More slightly negative updates: another ambiguous contributor to the Lightning Network codebase, under the username ZmnSCPxj, has pointed out a stark limitation of this promising network. Its ability to make multi-asset conversions is apparently limited by its current technical design: as the value of trade assets changes dramatically during specified trade windows, cross-asset exchange nodes on the Lightning Network will be exploited to create risk-free American Call Options. According to ZmnSCPxj: “significant liquidity will be tied up in such American Call Options, and they [the channels] find that they will lose funds — especially at times of volatility.”More on this in our next installment, in which we’ll also be addressing the relationship between the lightning network and XRP.",Digital Doppelgangers,https://medium.com/@DigitalDoppelgangers?source=post_page---byline--f2aad299e9b3---------------------------------------,679,8 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png,2019-02-03T06:47:34.734Z,Medium

Take the human qualities we are about to loose, back! I was at a VERY good conference last fall. Hosted byOslo Business Forum: The Future of Technology. Consistently throughout the whole day, my reaction after every person leaving the main stage, was:you nailed it!Thats rarely the case when I go to conferences. First of all, I was happy it was a lot about people — in the end, machines, robots and AIs wont be bias and evil, unless we, the makers are. So right people and diversity is more important than ever. Not only for the sake of good, but if you want to succeed, it’s the more certain path with asmarter team. To quote the Obama, (yeah, he you probably heard about before!) on Future of Technology recently: he couldn't make the right decision if he didn't have a diverse team around the table. He had to get data, expertise and info, that he could base his decision on, from his team. And to follow up on that, Andrew McAfee talked about the same thing, on the same conference. But from the other point of view: Beware of the HIPPO! (Highest-Paid-Persons-Opinion) Ever been in a meeting room, good team, lots of data, info and opinions from the different stakeholders. But in the end someone doesn’t listen to this and takes a decision based on gut feeling. And everyone leaves with a feeling of: why did they even ask us, if they don’t listen anyway. I think one of the most important things to make the right products and decisions going forward is to have a diverse team with you, and listen to them. We all hear about products being launched who was so bias that they had to remove the product from market immediately. No diversity, means nobody knows your product will work for others than your few team members. This is not new news, but still more important than ever. To have humans be human and have the right ones to lead.Kris Kutarnahad a very good talk around this. Him, I must see speak again! Also Silvija Seres nailed it! Look her up!

https://medium.com/@MikeFernandez/2018-year-in-review-for-southern-california-tech-1be84db9d343?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,2018 Year in Review for Southern California Tech,The Unicorn Club Keeps Growing,"Mike Fernandez Follow -- 2 Listen Share Last month marked my five year anniversary as an investor. I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had justrebrandedas Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinneythe coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential. Since then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors hasexploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company. The Unicorn Club Keeps Growing According to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla. Strong Exits Across the Region By far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next? Perhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investorspublicly rejectedon national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors. Another major acquisition for 2018 was that of Irvine-based Cylance by BlackBerry for $1.4B. Over the past few years, Cylance has joined CrowdStrike in building a cluster of cybersecurity expertise in Irvine, and we are already beginning to see a new generation of companies emerging out of Cylance’s success, such as Obsidian Security. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike has had a banner year and is hot on IPO watch-lists for 2019. The Scooter Invasion If Venice thought it would receive some respite from tech mania after the Snap IPO, it was sorely mistaken. Just a few months later, Travis VanderZanden released the first Bird Scooter onto the streets of Venice. Within a year, Bird would notch over 10 million rides, radically changing transportation in cities across the globe and setting a new benchmark for rapid growth. Wired Magazine even named 2018 the“Year of the Scooter”. In the process, the company raised over $400m from Sand Hill road heavyweights like Index, Sequoia, Accel, and CRV, as well as from almost every large SoCal-based firm: B Capital (where I work), Greycroft, Lead Edge, Upfront Ventures, Pritzker Group, and Sound Ventures, among others. Over the course of the year, Bird caused bikeshare company Lime to rapidly pivot into scooters and inspired a wave of copycats around the world. It drew Uber and Lyft into the market right in the middle of their IPO preparations. And it set off a wave of panic among municipal governments and regulators, who didn’t want to be caught flat footed in the face of a new technology on their streets. We are still in the early innings of the scooter game, but Bird’s rapidly expanding team has already shown it can continue to innovate rapidly, launching aGovTech platformand announcing an initiative to allow local operators tolaunching their own fleets. Time will tell how this market plays out, but Bird has been a clear proof point for Southern California’s ability to attract talent and capital to build world-changing businesses. The Housing Crisis and Looking Ahead 2018 was a year in which the tech industry was placed in the spotlight for its negative effects on society, ranging from Amazon’s HQ2 tax credit grab to the scourge of fake news. Perhaps the most pressing local issue has been tech’s impact on housing. Amid the backdrop of a much larger Southern California housing crisis, the clustering of startups around Venice and Santa Monica and large tech companies in Playa Vista and Culver City has put extreme pressure on housing prices on the Westside, leading to increasing arguments about gentrification, displacement, and what it means to be a good corporate neighbor. I am a firm believer that the long-term health of Southern California’s technology sector depends on its ability to continue to expand outside of Venice and Santa Monica, where there is simply lack of affordable housing options for employees within reasonable commuting distance. Greycroft was a pioneer in opening an office in the Arts District well before there was a notable cluster of tech companies in Downtown Los Angeles. The move is beginning to pay off, as large tech companies likeSpotifyput down roots and a new cluster of startups including the likes ofHollar,HopSkipDrive, andProducePaydecide to make DTLA home. I’m also encouraged to see clusters of great startups emerging in regions such as the Valley (e.g.Floqast,Papaya) and the Gateway Cities (e.g.Cargomaticin Long Beach andNext Truckingin Lynwood), where the local expertise in transportation and logistics is beginning to spawn tech-enabled challengers to a staid industry. As we look to 2019 and the future, we need to make sure that we foster these budding communities and give the same level of support that has helped the Westside produce so many winning companies. As the past year has shown, the growth in Southern California’s tech ecosystem will come from across the region, in sectors that we might not have anticipated. SoCal has finally proven without a doubt that it can compete across every subsector of tech, and the future continues to look bright.",Mike Fernandez,,154,6 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg,2019-01-01T03:35:37.195Z,Medium

DataArt Follow Mission.org -- 3 Listen Share Streaming Drives Music and Video Revenue While looking back at the past year, one thing becomes crystal clear: streaming has grown massively in 2017 and will continue to expand rapidly in 2018 and beyond. In fact, streaming has become the primary revenue driver for both music and video, thereby radically changing the way people consume content and profoundly altering the manner in which the industry and artists deliver media to fans. Digital music downloads are quickly decliningand being replaced by streaming, and it’s easy to understand why this is occurring. For the price of a single digital album download, consumers can gain access to tens of millions of songs via streaming services. And a growing number of music fans are making this switch, with over 100 million people now subscribed to such services around the world. According to the RIAA’s 2017 mid-year report, the U.S. recorded music industry experienced a 17% revenue increase in the first half of this year in comparison to 2016, and the primary driver of that growth is streaming. While total digital revenue accounted for $3.2 billion, or 84% of the total industry value, an impressive 62% came from streaming, equaling $2.5 billion. Video streaming revenue is also growingat a staggering rate with no signs of slowing down. According to a report by Research and Markets, video streaming revenue is forecast to increase from $30.29 billion in 2016 to an incredible $70.05 billion by 2021, as consumers continue to embrace pay TV and OTT solutions for streaming videos. Moving forward, it’s expected that OTT will experience the most substantial market growth rate based on the increasing use of digital platforms for the branding and marketing of products. Among other things, streaming powers the growth of digital distribution, creating more opportunities for independent artists. The world of independent music distribution has also expanded greatly over the past year, as a growing number of artists move away from major label deals to harness the personalized attention that indies can provide. UK-born companyDitto Music recently opened 12 new officesworldwide to serve its flourishing roster, while digital distribution and services companyFUGA has signed a dealwith London-based Ignition Records, following its expanding partnerships with a multitude of labels, including Epitaph Records and Ultra Records. EvenGoogle is getting into the musicindustry with a big investment in the new US-based digital music distribution startup UnitedMasters, which was founded by the one-time President of Urban Music at Interscope Records, Steve Stoute. Not surprisingly, the competition for streaming dollarshas been growing exponentially. One of the biggest recent stories wasDisney’s announcementthat it is severing its distribution deal with Netflix in favor of launching its own streaming service in 2019. And now it isofficially confirmedthat Disney is buying some of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, including the Fox movie and television studio and a share of Hulu, which will allow Disney to increase its television production to provide exclusive content on its forthcoming streaming offering. Althoughsome are still skepticalabout the long-time inflow of streaming dollars, the streaming war is already fierce, and the battle is indeed just beginning. As companies attempt to secure dominance, technology will prove to be the best weapon in the streaming arsenal, thereby separating the leaders from the pack in the coming year. The Future Is Data-Driven, So What Does The Data Say? As digital and streaming solutions increasingly dominate the media industry, the role of data is rapidly evolving from being important to becoming absolutely vital. At this point, streaming has already grown to be the primary revenue driver for both music and video, making the effective analysis and utilization of data an essential component for success. Technological advancements continue to transformevery aspect of the media industry, from artist and concept development to licensing and the manner in which people consume their favorite music and TV shows. And data sits in the center of this entertainment revolution. A thorough understanding of music data is a critical piece of the puzzle. Although this industry is notoriously unpredictable, data’s capacity to accurately predict and reveal insights makes it an incredibly powerful tool. An excellent example of this potential was illustrated by Jon Davies, Director of EU Music Partnerships at Shazam, who stated the app’s remarkable ability to utilize data in order to predict a hit from six to eight weeks in advance. Data’s importance in the evolving world of television cannot be overstated, as consumers are presented with an increasing number of content and delivery choices driven by data-based decisions. An extensive report from communications technology and services company Ericsson clearly reveals the massive changes occurring in TV. For one, the firm’s study found that approximately 70% of consumers now watch television and videos on a smartphone, which is double the percentage from just five years ago. Ericsson predicts that by 2020, just 10% of people will watch TV only on a traditional screen, which would mark a 50% decrease in comparison to 2010. And as an increasing number of people embrace new technologies, many experts believe that VR will become an essential aspect of television and video in the not-too-distant future, with its social and immersive potential being realized in innovative and exciting new ways. The skillful utilization of data is critical for success, while learning to be data-driven involves the extensive involvement of automation, machine learning and AI. The intricate melding of first, second and third-party data allows industry players to get the best results out of an algorithm, thereby positioning data to lead the way to making more effective decisions. Although humans will always be an essential part of successful enterprises, the complexities involved in analyzing massive quantities of data must be handled by machines as we move forward. Otherwise, the information will overwhelm and confuse us instead of providing invaluable insights into the habits and preferences of the swiftly-transforming consumer landscape. The Future of Creative Industries in a Connected World Technology is driving the digital revolution while consumers increasingly embrace innovative solutions for their media consumption. Global smartphone ownership crossed the 2 billion mark in 2014 and it’s expected to reach an incredible 4.6 billion by 2019. Our world is now connected through the internet and social media in ways that exceed even the wildest imaginations of technology innovators from the past. The growing access to a myriad of devices, such as smartphones, smart speakers, connected cars and connected homes, enables people to be online virtually anywhere and anytime, consuming music and television shows on-the-go. And it is this fundamental shift in consumer behavior and technological advancement that’s driving the rapid growth of music and video streaming, along with the rising importance of data and its ability to alter the creation and delivery of all media types. The coming year will bring a multitude of newutilizations of technologies to the forefront. It’s expected that voice-controlled technology will take on a much larger role in the near future, following the success of Amazon’s Echo smart home device and the company’s Alexa personal assistant. Forthcoming innovations in voice tech hold the potential to radically alter the manner in which consumers search for and listen to music, resulting in an even bigger impact on revenue moving forward. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will increasingly penetrate the media industry, as the analytical sector develops innovative solutions to make data input actionable. Perhaps most importantly, technology will continue to greatly improve the consumer experience. From enhancing discovery abilities to providing increasingly personalized and curated content delivery, the digital world holds the potential to entertain people in incredible ways that were once relegated to dreams.

Travis Scott in the background might help enhance your reading experience.” The Brief The Brief To start off, let’s define “Digital Technology” and “Digital Ecosystem” in its basic form. The term Digital Technology is used to describe the use of digital resources to effectively find, analyze, create, communicate, and use information in a digital context. The term “Digital Ecosystem” is an interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share standardized digital platforms for mutually beneficial purposes, such as commercial gain, innovation or common interest (i.e. skills development). In order to achieve a Digital Technology Ecosystem, addressing digital transformation capabilities such as Skills and Competency Development against traditional change is vital to understand the most effective practices likely to succeed in cultivating a culture of startup, innovation and human capital development. Additionally, adoption of technology plays an important role across digital transformation and having the right characteristics can help improve the chances of digital innovation and inclusion in Nigeria, such as: · Digital-savvy Leaders · Capability Building · Empowering Future Workforce · Using day-to-day Applications for communication, collaboration and management For instance, China has a culture of constant digital innovation and adoption of emerging technologies which drives expansion beyond traditional sector boundaries. In conjunction, companies implement significant reallocation of digital resources to embrace the agile culture. In Nigeria, the need to adopt technology to help meet digital challenges seems obvious. However, digital inclusion continues to fall behind other industries (Like the Entertainment) using technology to interact effectively with society. In addition, the ecosystem lacks access to quality skills development initiatives required to provide a culture of digital possibilities. Establishing a social mission with the aim of tackling the barriers that limit people’s capabilities and alerting businesses to digital change is vital for producing a shared digital inclusion experience. This is also important when considering the barriers to digital adoption, shifting dynamics between technology innovation, consumer services, socio-market analysis, and business forecasts. Hence, human capital development in the digital era should be designed around digital capacity and innovation development with the ability to embrace the ecosystem of students, consumers, professional, entrepreneurs, experts and businesses to achieve absolute digital inclusion. Socioeconomic Outlook — The why Socioeconomic Outlook — The why According to the National Bureau of Statistics Nigeria, the Labour Force Statistics report on unemployment and underemployment from Q3 2017 — Q3 2018 states: ·Working age population (15–64 years):Increased from 111.1 million in Q3, 2017 to 115.5 million in Q3, 2018. ·Labour force:Increased from 85.1 million in Q3 2017 to 90.5 million in Q3 2018. ·Employed (Full-time and part-time):Increased from 69.09 million in Q3 2017 to 69.54 million in Q3 2018. ·Classified as unemployed:(Did nothing at all or worked too few hours) Increased from 17.6 million in Q3 2017 to 20.9 million in Q3 2018, of which 11.1 million did some form of work but for too few hours a week and 9.7 million did absolutely nothing. About 90.1% of the “classified as unemployed” were first time job seekers and/or had never worked before, 9.9% were previously employed but lost their jobs at some point, 35% did nothing at all for less than a year, 17.2% for a year, 15.7% for two years and the remaining 32.1% for three years and over. ·Unemployment:Rate increased from 18.8% in Q3 2017 to 23.1% in Q3 2018. ·Unemployment and underemployment:Rate increased from 40% in Q3 2017 to 43.3% in Q3 2018. ·Men and women:In Q3 2018, 26.6% of women within the labor force (16–64 years) were unemployed, compared to 20.3% of men. ·Young People:As of Q3 2018, 55.4% (15–34 years) were either underemployed or unemployed compared to 52.6% in Q3 2017. Market Trends — The what and how Market Trends — The what and how Here is a head start, take a country and analyze the most complex industries, clients and consumer issues across a sector to help you visualize common pathway (trends, traits and patterns) and leverage the most preferred digital transformation practices across that sector. You will find out the most globally discussed topic in capacity development is the immense potential in people to create a digital transformed society. It is also well known that organizations strive to adopt numerous trends for their workforce towards digital inclusion and innovation development in order to increase growth and global agility. Nigeria, in its entirety, should in turn embrace the importance of this social dynamics. With business and technology innovation inextricably linked, the demand for capacity programs focused on entrepreneurship, hubs, technical skills and business are rapidly growing. In Nigeria, the advent of entrepreneurship programs like theAndela’sdevelopment of talented software developers,Nollywood Film Industry,International Musical ArtistandFashion Weekare the market forces galvanizing the ecosystem, whilst shedding light on the importance of social inclusion. Having said this, Nigerian primary focus is to start developing a culture of digital heroes for the young people, men and women (Unemployed and underemployed) across all sectors “Not digital in terms of entrepreneurs but digital in terms of future workforce” as they form the larger population by number and preparing them with the digital programs equipped for future development. The Ecosystem — Let’s do this The Ecosystem — Let’s do this A number of established startups and ventures capitals i.e.CCHub(Technology-oriented centre) andTony Elumelu Foundationare taking the initiatives in Nigeria creating dreams, hopes, promises and better innovation for much of the needed development in a number of sectors. Fundamentally, human capital development is one of the most important elements of societal success which requires creating the necessary environment for the workforce to learn better, apply innovative ideas, acquire new competencies, develop skills, behaviors and attitudes. This helps to create wealth and determine the pace of development. Seeking to achieve this requires investment and cultivation of a sustainable environment that will particularly address critical issues (Capacity building, organizing, connecting etc.) towards productivity for individuals, employers, or communities. Thus, increasingly seen as an integral part of digital inclusion to many of the challenges and socioeconomic factors. With the right initiatives geared towards economic, political, social/cultural development especially for young (15 -34 years) unemployed people, and the adoption of industry standards, convergence of technology innovation and social interactions, Nigeria will be able to empower an effective integration of digital transformation for all. It is therefore, hoped that implementing robust decentralized digital technology ecosystems will help build a culture of digital inclusion and human capital development.",Niyi Ogunleye,https://medium.com/@lani.ogunleye?source=post_page---byline--5621023d4cbf---------------------------------------,8,5 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4aBTb5mYgF1N1hAhefX1zA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*4aBTb5mYgF1N1hAhefX1zA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*4aBTb5mYgF1N1hAhefX1zA.jpeg,2019-01-03T11:14:10.937Z,Medium
https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-mythical-million-dollar-run-rate-cb0288a6eb31?source=tag_archive---------17-----------------------,The Mythical Million Dollar Run Rate,Written byFounder Collective,"Founder Collective Follow -- Listen Share People obsess about college rankings, baseball stats, and other forms of numerology out of a natural human desire to simplify and bring order to their world. Seed stage startups often do this by fixating on a single revenue number — a million-dollar run rate. As far as round numbers go, a million dollars of annual revenue is a great sign of progress. Once upon a time, it really was a marker that made a meaningful difference in raising a Series A, but the imaginary milestone of $83K in MRR isn’t the ticket to a Series A that it was five years ago. Over the last half-decade, there’s been substantial inflation in round sizes, to the point where a Series A has the dimensions, and prerequisites, of what would have been closer to a Series B round 5 years ago. When evaluating decks, Series A investors won’t treat companies with $900K and $1.1M in annual revenue differently. Today, the benchmarks to land a series A often include several million dollars of revenue, accelerating at an impressive velocity, and combined with well-rounded leadership teams, and impressive customer rosters. The bar has meaningfully moved from five years ago. Still, many founders fetishize it this one number. They insist it’s what’s keeping VCs from taking them seriously. They’ll increase their burn and spend inappropriately to get to it. And most of the time, this is a waste of focus and resources. The better advice is to grow revenue as quickly as you can, sustainably, and focus most of your attention on helping investors answer one critical question. Venture capital is a velocity business and every good VC’s portfolio is going to have a few companies that have taken off like a rocket ship. Investors want to know why you’ll be like that company, and not one of a dozen slow-growing zombie startups from whose boards they can’t escape. Casper earned$100M its 2nd year in business. Coinbase got to abillion dollars in revenuein under five years. These are outliers, to be sure, and most VC’s portfolios are filled with more modest growth stories, but VC is an outliers business and investors want to believe they have a chance to invest in one. If your current run rate doesn’t put you in that category, you must answer the question of how you will become one. VCs have an idea of what the outlier trajectory of a successful startup should look like, and the steps necessary to achieve it. It’s the founder’s job to connect the dots for the investor and present a credible picture of how they’re making it happen. The challenge is, the longer it takes a company to accelerate, the harder it is to believe the company can become a unicorn. You want your startup to be perceived as a “potential fund returner,” not a “solid business.” When a VC looks at your deck and sees that you’ve spent $5M in various forms of seed funding over the space of four years to get to a million dollar run rate, it gets harder to believe this startup is going to make “the leap” in year four. It’s the founder’s job to tell a credible story about the product launch, marketing channel, or new customer that will triple (or more) your revenue in 18 months. To be clear, the point isn’t that you should mount a PR campaign to try to build buzz for an otherwise struggling startup or start telling stories that won’t come true. Instead, the point is to focus on the substantive changes required to massively accelerate organic revenue growth. Your job is to provide evidence of sustainable and accelerating growth, not to chase expensive and temporary “hacks” to add a small amount of revenue in hopes of meeting a mythical benchmark. More importantly, if your company isn’t on this path and starting to connect the dots to the hope curve, not only will fundraising be somewhat painful, but artificially trying to put your company on this path can be catastrophic. Put simply, don’t spend your last $1M of funding on ads to grow revenue run rate from $600K to $1.1M. Use it to figure out how to demonstrate you’ll be able to go from $1M to $5M. Everything else is a distraction. AsDavid Frankelhas explored previously, there are many reasons that revenue alone won’t guarantee funding.A million dollars in revenue won’t get you funded if you’ve got a direct competitor that was founded at the same time and has managed to get to a $10M run rate in the same time. Or if what you’re building a business that doesn’t have a network effect, data asset, or another strategic asset. Instead of obsessing about an arbitrary notion of what some investor might care about and spending your finite resources in a low-probability bid to meet that goal, consider how you might use those remaining seed dollars to get to breakeven and change the game. As you learn more about the levers you can pull to achieve sustainable growth, the more confidence you’ll have. You’ll also quickly learn the easiest way to get venture capital is not to need it. There are dozens of companies — Dyn, Lynda, Wayfair, SimpliSafe, anddozens more— who used very little venture capital but became extraordinary companies. .",Founder Collective,,234,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png,2019-01-02T14:01:05.905Z,Medium

Kristopher Saber Follow UX Collective -- Share In the domain of User Experience, one popular thought pattern seems to prevail; UX is limited to the digital space. But this is not true. UX is something that is deeply rooted in the foundation of the business as I’ve talked about in the pasthere. I’m going to walk-through a practical example of what I meant in the previous article. Let’s take a business right from the very inception. It’s you and your buddy-you’re both talking over drinks. You two have been talking out an idea for a new service that’s going to revolutionize how people watch shows. It specifically streams series and movies that can be viewed in Virtual Reality (VR), and the service even sends you an Oculus Go when you sign up for a yearly subscription. Your friend is convinced that this idea will make you two millions: “Who doesn’t want to watch series in VR?”Your friend says.

Worry not, in this guide I will help you Creating a repository Let’s start off by creating a github repository. On github web interface, find New button. From there, enter a new repository name and choose a license (e.g. MIT). Github does not have a default .gitignore for .net projects, so leave it empty for now. Starting up your project Next thing we need to do is cloning the newly created repository. (You may use “git clone {repouri}”). First thing we need to do is creating a .gitignore for our project. The easyest way is just copying the file from another open source project (e.g.https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/master/.gitignore) Now we can finally copy the library code to the repository. I prefer to put the source code in a “src” directory, but it’s entirely up to you. For an open source library, you should strongly consider adding SourceLink supporthttps://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink.This allows other developers to debug through your code. Versioning Versioning is very hard! If you are not fancy manually versioning each and every package, I suggest using automated tools for that. The best tool I’ve been working with ishttps://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.This small command line tool parses the tags and branch information and is capable if incrementing the versions on it’s own! It requires zero configuration, but should you really need to adjust some values, you may place a config file to the root of your repository. In the next section, I will show you how to integrate this tool into CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipeline I personally think that the whole CI/CD process (outside of CI vendor-specific tasks) should be fully reproducible locally. Therefore, I recommend defining build steps using either Cake (https://github.com/cake-build/cake) Fake (https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE) or Nuke(https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke). I personally prefer Nuke, for it’s incredible integration with IDE and outstanding CLI tools. To get started with NUKE: Install nuke global tool (dotnet tool install -g Nuke.GlobalTool) From the root folder of your repository, execute “nuke :setup” Follow the prompts on the screen. Make sure to include GitVersion setup. After you go through the setup process, you should be able to see a new project appear in your solution. And it already has some steps defined for you! There is some customization required. You need to include the pack target for creating a nuget package and include reporting of test results. You may also want to create a target that combines the other targets in a pipeline to be called by the CI tool. A sample with those commands could be found in my repositoryhere. Now, commit all the changes to source control and let’s add the Azure Pipelines integration. Create a new project in Azure Pipelines. Use may want to you public project type for your open source project. Create a new pipeline. In the location, choose Github. Hit authorize button to authorize yourself on Github, and then choose a project. Next, edit a pipeline file. Since in our case we use Nuke to build our project, you only need to call nuke for all the build process, and then you can just use publish artifact steps to publish your artifacts You are done! The sample pipeline file could be found below. It will automatically trigger the build on branches specified. Add a badge to you github repo. From the build pipeline, hit the 3 dots menu and choose StatusBadge button. This will open a page with MD preset. Include this into your Readme.MD that can be found in the root of your repository. Publishing to nuget First, if you’ve done everything according to the samples provided, you can trigger the build on Azure DevOps and the resulting nuget packages will be available in the build artifacts Download the package and go to nuget.org. Find the upload button and simply drag and drop the nupkg file. Your package will go through validation process, and after it finishes it should be available for download. That’s it!",SleepyManiac,https://medium.com/@sleepymaniac?source=post_page---byline--4dd00521b1ac---------------------------------------,64,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*H4G_1sC_V_g3RoLCmGaz4w.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*XUvdIOypfu1Zzeh3wAEaYA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*XUvdIOypfu1Zzeh3wAEaYA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*XUvdIOypfu1Zzeh3wAEaYA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*H4G_1sC_V_g3RoLCmGaz4w.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*H4G_1sC_V_g3RoLCmGaz4w.jpeg,2019-01-19T14:13:23.432Z,Medium

Safety and antivirus apps are also great, but what if your device is infected already? If your Android device is suddenly slow, uses too much data or displays corrupted data, you could have downloaded an app infected with malware — or ransomware that is much more obvious. Suspicious apps — frequently promising free work software, cheat codes, new games, porn or money — are an increasingly common way of getting viruses on your mobile devices, where they damage and steal data.

Things like Anime and J-Pop are becoming a trend now, attracting audiences from all over the world. Japan is also known as a country that has more advanced technology. In this very country, you can see the giant companies that produce all the interesting games that we play today onour beloved consoles. However, as you may know already, Japan is also known to be a country with advanced robotic technology and also delicious foods. What if those two aspects are combined into one? The result is quite amazing, The Robot Restaurant Tokyo. What is it? So, what’s this place all about? The Robot Restaurant is a specially themed restaurant and also bar with pop culture performances that related heavily in one topic,the wonderful robotics. Inside the restaurant, you can some eye-opening stuff like lasers, dancers who are using futuristic clothing, an actual robots performance, and many more. The Music inside this place is really loud and heart pumping. From all the decorations from outside, many people are interested to enter. Aside from attracting the local tourists, this place is also a well-known place for all the foreign tourists who visit Tokyo. When entering this combined place of restaurant and bar, the visitors will experience the one and a half hours of entertainment. Surely, visiting this place should be a very memorable moment for any tourists out there. Location In case you’re wondering, the location of this place is right in the Kabukicho 1–7–1, Shinjuku, Tokyo. It’s actually not far from Shinjuku City Office Main Building and the famous Samurai Museum. This place is also very easy to notice, remembering that there’s the giant ROBOT RESTAURANT sign that can be seen easily. What’s Inside? Now, for the ultimate question that needs an answer, what’s inside this Robot Restaurant Tokyo? Right near the entrance, you need to pay first for about 8000 Yen (which is like 72 dollars). You can also do booking online attheir official site. However, you need to come at least 30 minutes before the show starts if you want to pay on the spot. If you late, your reservation will be canceled. Also, you’ll be greeted with two big robot ladies that sometimes moving and scare the kids. People are always taking pictures with them before entering the place. On the street, there are robots who invite people to come. For the people who are still confused about the way to reach the restaurant, they can also order the shuttle bus service exclusively for them. With this, the visitors don’t need to worry because the bus will pick you up right from the hotel. So let’s continue to explore. The schedule for everyday performances is basically the same. There are about four stages that will be held in every single day. Starting from the first one that opens from 15.00 to the main show at 16:00. The second one starts from 16:45 to 17:55. Third stage from 19:00–19:50. And the last stage from 21:00–21:45. Inside the restaurant, you can enjoy some drinks first before actually witnessing the great battle of robots. The performances are always eye-catching and really go on the full speed. The audiences are glued to their chairs as an array of attracting dancers, singers, and the other performers who will take you the world or robots, at least for about 90 minutes. There will be drum performance, robots, titans, and fictional characters that you may witness in cartoon or anime. Each performance brings more excitement and more excitement to the audience. Even though they look so bizarre and random, but these performances will surely be remembered by all. With the neons, robots, dances, laugh, and songs, the night would be one of the best one. For some people who also want to enjoy a calmer performance, they can go watch the Robot Resturant Chorus which located near the bar. There are nine singers in total who will amaze everyone in the bar. Even though it looks very contrast, but it’s still a wonderful thing to enjoy in this restaurant. Food and Beverage In the middle of the show, the restaurant serves snacks and drinks for the audience. They can buy them starting from 1.00 to 1.500 Yen. They sell three types of meal here that consist of Food A, B, and C. If you’re ordering the Food A, you can get Grilled Beef Dinner Box with mineral water. For the Foo B, there’s a Japanese style Dinner Box and mineral water. The Food C consists of a simple set of Robot Sushi with mineral water. The Tokyo Robot Restaurant is always good for people who want to have some fun in Tokyo. Everything is always so memorable and random. Each perfomence will leave a wonderful memory of laugh, crazyness, and excitement. That’s why, to us, this place is surely a must-visit place in Tokyo. The 8000 yen you paid on the entrance is always worth it.

https://medium.com/@j2global/why-does-faxing-still-exist-in-2019-66bf27e0c7b2?source=tag_archive---------90-----------------------,Why Does Faxing Still Exist in 2019?,Written byJ2 Global,"J2 Global Follow -- 1 Listen Share A popular misconception is thatonline faxingandfax machineusage is in decline. However, the opposite is true. Fax usage continues to grow. In fact, according to a recent study from International Data Corporation (IDC), one of the largest global market intelligence firms, 82 percent of survey respondents said fax usage increased over the past year, while only 19 percent said usage went down. Findings from IDC’s comprehensive study were surprising to those who believed fax usage was dwindling. Highlights of the Report: Fax grew 27 percent over the previous year for respondents that showed growth, and projections for these companies showed 25 percent growth over the next 24 months. Faxingis considered a reliable and trusted source of secure information exchange. One of the key drivers for fax volume is the growing accessibility and simplicity of fax technology. Due to the continued use of fax by consumers as well as suppliers, companies are forced to meet those demands. The growth of cloud fax services is predicted to continue. IT Professionals Weigh In on the Relevance of Fax Spiceworks’ 500,000 strong membership of Information Technology professionals were recently polled on the ongoing reliance of fax. They discovered that approximately 89 percent of small to medium-sized organizations still use fax in some form, whether it’s fax servers, fax machines, or online fax services. Surprisingly, 62 percent of IT pros still support physical fax machines. Poll results revealed the top 10 reasons faxing remains widely used: The familiarity and comfort level of physical fax machines from previous generations Organizations understand that many customers still prefer faxing The use of faxing is still encouraged, though not enforced, by government standards Legal discovery relies heavily on a paper trail with transaction reports A common belief that fax remains the safest communication against viruses A general consensus that faxing is far more affordable than alternative secure information exchange Due to strict guidelines for regulatory compliance The convenience of scanning, copying and sending faxes from any web-enabled device It’s a cheap and simple backup communication platform It remains a challenge to get organizations to adopt to new and alternate communication technologies The Future of Faxing As long as there are hard, paper copies of documents, there will be fax machines. And while you might not have sent a single fax in the last decade (or ever, if you’re under a certain age), for many organizations the fax will continue as a trusted source of secure information exchange. Fortunately, as digital transformation sweeps across all industries, there is an alternative to traditional faxing that is changing how businesses send and receive documents securely: Cloud Faxing. It is secure,convenient, and not dependent on a physical machine. Online faxing increases efficiencies in workflow by eliminating the need for employees to wait by the fax machine, wait for confirmations, or risk compliance regulations by having loose papers on a community machine. It also lowers costs, as there is no need to buy toner, paper, or even provide fax maintenance. Faxing through the power of the cloud with providers like eFax remains one of the driving forces behind the growth of faxing today. To try online faxing or switch to a cloud fax model,sign up with eFax today.

There are a lot of tech predictions at the beginning of each year. Scientists, engineers, and industrialists trying to sum up results of the past year and identify trends for the new. But as it happens, opinions even from famous expertsworth nothing. So I think that we can trust only data for figuring out what is going on in the world.

Smartphonevendors shippeda total of355.2 million unitsduring the third quarter of 2018, resulting in a year-over-year decline of6.0%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines for the global smartphone market. For me, it’s a signal that soon we will see a wave of new devices because huge corporations badly live in the already settled market. Innovations and novelties are needed for them.

https://uxdesign.cc/an-ode-to-spotify-a-good-product-with-great-product-thinking-9842b3447f5a?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,An ode To Spotify: a good product with great product thinking,Published inUX Collective,"Viba Mohan Follow UX Collective -- 2 Listen Share If you ask my classmates, they’ll tell you that I’m obsessed with Spotify. I’ve based several of my projects on it. I reference it as a great product while citing examples during class discussions. And you’ll constantly find me advocating for it as the best music streaming service available. This isn’t quite simply because I think Daniel Ek(the founder) is a genius, it’s also because I think the product is a beauty all by itself. So as I look at this IDEO Pop Quiz question “What product do you find the most relevant & interesting?” — to me it‘s a no brainer. Ithasto be Spotify. Why, you ask? Well for one, think about what our lives looked like before Spotify. Here in India, you’d find people from all walks of life pirating music and then liberally sharing it with their friends. Even a child will be able to tell you that it’s difficult for an artist to make a living in a society like that. Sure, there was the occasional audiophile who’d collect music CDs and care for them like it was worth a fortune — because it was. But Spotify was built in an era when trust, in the music industry, was running at an all time low. Record companies would sue individuals and organisations alike for pirating music. And musicians were railing against their fans for the same. They uprooted the existing boundaries of music and redefined them in ways that I still don’t fully understand. They balanced out the needs of artists and their fans. Fans were tired of the tediousness of downloading illegal music and the fiscal costs of actually purchasing music. They were struggling with issues of loyalties to their favourite artists and they weren’t able to discover new music that felt personal yet trendy. Artists on the other hand needed to make a living and needed to truly connect with their audience. So, in the age of commercialisation, they built a product with a vision to simultaneously uplift artists, personalise music for listeners and provide smaller artists with the kind of audience they could only hope to tap into. As a designer, I recognise this to be excellent product thinking. They recognised key opportunities and exploited them in a healthy manner. They listened to their users and adapted as and when needed. To build on personalisation, they integrated a couple of niche features — like Spotify Unwrapped, Spotify Singles, playlists from your favourite artists and Daily Mixes. Spotify Unwrapped not only serves the purpose of being a subtle, high level campaign that markets the product, but also helps users feel more connected to the app and the music that they listen to. In a quaint, unimposing manner it takes you through a memory lane filled with nostalgia and triggers the pride of belonging to an artists fandom. For example, someone listened to 3000 hours of ODESZA on Spotify and now the entire ODESZA community revers him as this sort of legendary #1 fan. They built a community in a way that most apps could only dream of. And they did so by directly adding value to their users lives. Which might be what drew me to Spotify in the first place. While other streaming services cater to the simple tasks of listening to and sharing music, Spotify drew out complex yet subtle interactions that help users connect to artists in ways that they never quite did before. Plus, in this day and age, I think that they are especially relevant because they give artists a voice and a platform to reach an audience they may have otherwise never acquired. The cynic will tell you that streaming services like Spotify are killing artists. But I have a different take on this. The typical artist believes that if they keep playing shows, they’ll one day get discovered and then catapult their way into fame and fortune. But that’s not how the world works. This might be the reality of a privileged few — those who were maybe born into wealth and influence might be able to ease their way into a scenario like this, but for the average Joe, it’s their job to build their career. I’m aware that Spotify pays artists mere pennies for each stream. But the opportunity cost of a service like Spotify is more free ranging than providing an artist with a steady source of income. Spotify won’t build an artists career. It never claimed it would. But it will provide them with the data to locate and analyse their followers, connect them concerts and merchandise and boost the rate at which they are being discovered. It will help an artist find people who connect with their music and it is the job of the artist to transform passive listeners to active fans. People want a fantasy, but Spotify was built for the present day reality. A career in music is a privilege. Not everyone can hope to do this. But Spotify helps make it possible. And in my books this is both interesting and relevant because it mirrors the paradigm shift that is on going in a new society that provides you with unconventional opportunities that when met with creativity can prove to be extremely rewarding. So maybe what I’m trying to say is that I love Spotify because Spotify is a great product with ingenious product thinking.",Viba Mohan,https://medium.com/@viba?source=post_page---byline--9842b3447f5a---------------------------------------,419,4 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg,2019-01-02T03:35:46.306Z,Medium
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2019-b4142f38df20?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019,Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019,"Eric Elliott Follow JavaScript Scene -- 36 Listen Share It’s that time of year again: The annual overview of the JavaScript tech ecosystem. Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019 React still hasmuch higher satisfaction ratings than Angularfor the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The newReact hooks APIreplaced theclassAPI I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (TheclassAPI still works, but the hooks API is reallymuch better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (seedetails), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. Data Sources We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: Google Search trends.Not my favorite indicator, but good for a big picture view. Package Downloads.The aim here is to catch real users in the act of using the framework. Job board postings from Indeed.com.Using the same methodology from previous years for consistency. Google Search Trends React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package Downloads Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScriptacross all sectors (including the enterprise)is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy appsnever upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous yearscombined. Job Board Postings Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year,we tally the job postings¹mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: React: 24,640 Angular: 19,032 jQuery: 14,272 Vue: 2,816 Ember (not pictured): 2,397 Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we needqualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. Methodology:Job searches were conducted on Indeed.com. To weed out false positives, I paired searches with the keyword “software” to strengthen the chance of relevance, and then multiplied by ~1.5 (roughly the difference between programming job listings that use the word “software” and those that don’t.) All SERPS were sorted by date and spot checked for relevance. The resulting figures aren’t 100% accurate, but they’re good enough for the relative approximations used in this article. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic:“Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. On TypeScript TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated becausetype safety does not appear to be a real thing(does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), andtype inferencein JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in atransducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s.

That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations ofthe internet of value.Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read“Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. Other Tech to Watch As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learningis in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applicationsare quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively usethe Twitter PWA instead. AR(Augmented Reality)VR(Virtual Reality)MR(Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to becomeXR(eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous VehiclesAutonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computingprogressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent reportputs things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

Cook,"Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share One could argue that the state of music listening — with streaming services giving us access to a nearly limitless array of choices — has never been better. On the other hand, there is something satisfying about owning an album, and physically grabbing it from a stack of media, an experience that is lost in this virtual shuffle. Designer Chris Pattyhas some up with a solution to this dilemma — a music player housed in a nicely finished block of wood that uses cards to select the song. Users pick a card with the single to be played out of one of two rectangular card holders, then swipe it through a mag-stripe reader slot. This type of card was chosen over the NFC variety to save costs, though according to Patty, it’s actually quite satisfying to swipe cards like this. Cleverly, the art on the cards is pulled from Spotify with a custom user interface, then printed as stick-on labels. Under the nicely carved wooden “hood,” the system features a speaker powered by aRaspberry Pi, with songs stored locally.

FromGoogle Cloud Study Jam, which introduced developers to platforms likeKubernateesandDockertoGoogle I/OExtendedevent,which touched on Android and Google Web technologies, also to theWomen Tech Makers Event,which was an avenue for women to learn more and get involved in the tech community. There was alsoFlutter Study Jamwhich helped developers get familiar with the Flutter technology for Mobile development. The last which wasDevFest Lagoswhere GDG Ibadan actively participated in presentations and planning. In all of these events, we had many developers learn from various facilitators within and outside the community and their contributions have made the community grow significantly well. It will not be good to end our 2018 story without mentioning that two Engineers from the community (in the persons of Goke Obasa and Yemi Olaoye) who Doubled as our top Organizers relocated to Germany in pursuit of their career as Software Engineers. This happened to be one of our top highlights for the previous year. The introduction of the Google Hangouts LIVE eventAsk Me Anything with Devsformed part of our avenues to reachout the more to everyone, encouraging them to grow and invest in themselves to be better at what they do especially in terms of acquiring technical skills and being able to solve problems with technology. We are happy to announce that there were many positive reports from members of the community. Many have learnt from all the sessions and are currently putting lessons learnt to use. We will like to thank our Speakers on these sessions for their time and for their willingness to give back, We thankAbiola Ibrahim, Emmanuel ObidiegwuZaga,Omoloro Oyegoke, Yemi Olaoye,Goke Obasaand Funsho Popoola.

Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet, but for Blockchain the future is bright.",Farhang Maghdeed,https://medium.com/@farhang.maghdeed?source=post_page---byline--7aea67809a78---------------------------------------,0,2 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png,2019-01-02T08:31:00.664Z,Medium

Cook Follow -- Listen Share Maker “theguymasamato” and his kids have amassed a large number of trading cards, so much so that organizing and sorting them is quite difficult. In order to help with this job, he’s building a sorting machine. He previously created acard feeder mechanism, and in part two of this ambitious project, he’s come up witha lazy susan-like deviceto place the cards in 22 separate rectangular holders made out of cardboard. This is meant to accommodate the 21 sets of cards in the Wold of Warcraft universe, plus an extra container for unidentified cards. The machine is constructed out of wood, and turns with the help of steel balls to reduce friction, forming a sort of gigantic thrust bearing. A stepper motor powers the rotating surface, with cardboard strips formed into gear teeth to interface between the two. AnArduino Uno, along with a motor shield provides control, and when fully implemented, the device will use a homing sensor to ensure the correct tray is in place under the feeder mechanism. While an impressive display of cardboard craftsmanship, the assembly will still need to be integrated with the feeder, plus a method of identifying the cards. It will be interesting to see it come together, and as of now, it’s great reference material for any projects requiring a large turntable.",Jeremy S.

I told to arunjunai we will try. We started to explore on internet. Arunjunai again opened that find my iPhone app on my Mac laptop.

We quickly planned something so that we can continue our trip from next day 30 December onwards and me and arunjunai will go to KATPADI railway station to register a complaint. In a funny way, I named this operation asMission ARUNJUNAI :) I booked a train ticket. Me and arunjunai started to travel towards KATPADI. From katpadi to anvarthikanpettai by bus. While traveling in train the inspector of RPF ARAKONAM called arunjunai and enquired about the incident. Arunjunai could not recognize thief face, dress color, height weight etc… He is simply blind about a thief. RPF inspector said you would have pulled thechainin a train. But arunjunai didn’t. Finally, an inspector said first register the complaint in a katpadi station. Now hanish reached anvarthikanpettai police station. Police told katpadi station controlling this area you should go there And he said it’s not easy to get back your iPhone. So try to forget it. Arunjunai lost his hope. The train reached katpadi station at 1.50 PM. We went to Katpadi Government Railway Police station(GRPS) They enquired about the incident.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/political-revolution-and-the-blockchain-18751b780f12?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,Political Revolution and the Blockchain: A Tale of Two Paradigm Shifts,Published inHackerNoon.com,"Will Mekemson Follow HackerNoon.com -- 2 Listen Share It is the best of times, it is the worst of times, it is the age of Wikipedia, it is the age of memes, it is the epoch of free speech, it is the epoch of murdered journalists, it is the season of grassroots campaigns, it is the season of dark money politics, it is the spring of artificial intelligence, it is the winter of climate change, we have everything before us, we have nothing before us — in short, the present period in its collision of technology, global society, and communication is beyond a superlative degree of comparison to any other. The past ten years has seen internet access grow bynearly three billion people, from around 20% of the global population to over 50%, improving literacy, access to information, and introducing the ability to instantaneously communicate on a global scale. Meanwhile, computing power is followingMoore’s Lawand roughly doubling in cost-to-output every 18 months. Some even predict atechnological singularitybetween human and artificial intelligence when the linear chart ‘goes vertical’. Combined with the realities of climate change, regressive political policies, and coordinated disinformation campaigns, this watershed moment brings the possibility of either catastrophic consequences or vast improvement to global conditions in a relatively minuscule amount of time. In this piece, I will give a brief overview of current conditions in politics, society, and technology, their effects on each other, and how the advancement of blockchain systems can address some of the challenges faced today. In the summer of 2015, when Senator Bernie Sanders announced he would be running for President of the United States, I dropped everything to return to the U.S. and help. What began as volunteering to knock on doors grew into opening campaign offices, organizing events, recruiting volunteers, and more face-to-face political conversations than I could count. Collectively, a small grassroots campaign for awareness began to snowball into the largest ground-swell of political involvement in modern US History. Advocating for Bernie was easy, you just need to empathize with others and share Bernie’s own words. For nearly every reactionary mistake that the US federal government has made in the last 30 years, Bernie has been speaking in favor of progress. Supporting civil and gay rights, opposing military interventionism, and advocating for education and social welfare, Bernie has been tireless in his advocacy for a sensible government that works for everyone. However, there was one campaign slogan that many found hard to support — Political Revolution. For many, the word revolution conjures imagery of violent coups, anarchy, and the guillotine. While this interpretation is not without historical justification, it is not inherent in the broader definition of the word: The paradigms of politics and technology are being challenged, with major adjustments in the very way that we organize and interpret the world around us. Wealthy interests and corrupt politicians continue to manipulate economic markets and governments, often eroding democratic institutions, but the shifting power of technology, communication, and information has presented us with great opportunities. In a democracy, the ability to have open, honest, and fair elections is the foundation upon which all other problems can be addressed. With social media allowing information to be spread faster than can be credibly fact-checked, it is not surprising that falsehoods and outright propaganda have become a major problem. In Brazil, conservative anti-minority and pro-torture Jair Bolsonaro coordinated with international firms tospread lies and propagandaagainst his opponents through WhatsApp, the popular Facebook-owned messenger. In Russia, the “Internet Research Agency” employed thousands of people to create and disseminate propaganda to US voters, visible toover 126 million users on Facebook alone, and the Mueller-led investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia so far has issued36 indictments and 5 Trump aids have struck plea deals. We must also be careful, however, we do not react with censorship on the internet itself as a utility. While individual companies like Facebook and Twitter are obviously free to operate freely, banning users, language, and images as they wish, the internet itself as a utility must remain open and transparent, letting the good outweigh the bad. In Syria, the volunteer White Helmets rescue group uses social media, combined with aircraft sensors and machine learning algorithms, to quickly warn of incoming bombs and missiles and coordinate rescue efforts. It is estimated these decentralized early warning systems havereduced casualties by 27%in heavily bombarded areas. The pro-democracy “Arab Spring” movement began with a rapidly sharedvideo of a street vendorsetting himself on fire in front of a local government office, protesting the government harassment of his fruit stand. Online communication and coordination spread through numerous countries faster than efforts to censor it. While the spread of falsehoods and propaganda is disruptive, it can be combated with the truth. The more existential threat to elections in the USA is dark money and Super PACs. A Super PAC is a Political Action Committee that is technically separate from and has no communication with, a political candidate. Thanks to the Supreme Court decision inCitizens United vs Federal Election Commission, a Super PAC can raise and spend unlimited sums of money on advertising, not disclose who their donors are, and advocate for or against specific candidates as long as there is no evidence of direct coordination. This is a perversion of electoral democracy that allows secret funding of political organizations to bombard all forms of media with advertising that is often misleading or inaccurate. In the 2016 elections,over $1.4 billion of dark money was spent by Super PACs. Wealthy individuals and corporations give massive amounts of money to both the official election campaigns and Super PACs, and in turn elected officials make decisions at to their benefit. That is, unless you believe it is purely coincidence thatInternet Service Providers gave over $100 million to congressional campaigns before Net Neutrality was destroyed, or thatHalliburton won massive no-bid government contracts in Iraqwhile Dick Cheney, their former CEO, was Vice President, or that oil, gas, and coal companies spent $354 million in campaign contributions in 2016while receiving $29.4 billion in federal subsidies? Or perhaps when President Trump’s Justice Department settled a $230 million Russian money laundering case involving New York real estate for just $6 million dollars, it was a coincidence that the lawyer representing Russia hadpreviously organized the now-famous Trump Tower meetingbetween herself, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump campaign officials. Speaking of shadowy money, it has been estimated that the Department of Defense and Department of Housing and Urban Development have misappropriated$21 trillionin unsupported adjustments from 1998–2015. The complete lack of voter oversight of how tax dollars are spent is astounding. We also recently witnessed the largest document leak in history known as thePanama Papers, detailing information on more than 200,000 offshore entities and exposing how world leaders, businessmen, and celebrities from over 200 countries used shell corporations for fraud, tax evasion, and skirting international sanctions. Yet despite 1,260 companies named in Nevada alone, almost no prosecution has happened in the USA because companies and wealthy individuals haveperfectly legalways to hide their money offshore. Compounding onto the problem of voter disinformation and dark money influences, the USA faces very real problems of electoral fraud and voter disenfranchisement. While some issues have seen progressive advances in recent decades, such asreturning voting rights to felons, the ability for eligible voters to be registered and able to vote should be a non-starter. The 2018 elections wererampant with election fraud and voter disenfranchisement. In Ohio, heavily African-American neighborhoods saw ten percent of registered voters purged from lists, compared to four percent in surrounding areas. In North Carolina, theevidence is mountingthat absentee ballots were collected by political operatives and only turned in for Republican voters. In Georgia, 53,000 voter registrants wereplaced in a “pending” statusdue to minor misspellings or missing hyphens prior to the election, and a predominantly African-American county had toreject a plan to close seven polling locations. The Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp had removed an estimated 1.5 million people from voter rolls during his tenure and oversaw the very election in which he was running for Governor. Dodge City Kansas, with a population of 27,000, had its single polling location moved outside the city. All across the country, fewer polling locations have resulted in longer lines, with many voters unable to take enough time from work to participate. These conditions happen despite the USA having a very low turnout of around 50%. Studies showthat automatic voter registration increases participation, with twelve states having passed legislation since 2015. Moving election day to a weekend or having a national holiday may also increase turnout. The key to addressing major regressive policies is to first confront electoral fraud, voter rights, and the influence of money in politics. From there, voters will have the electoral tools to fight numerous injustices still prevalent in modern society. We could begin with the$5 billion for-profit prison industry that is unaccountable to the public, the growing number ofcivilians killed by drone strikes,whistle-blowers being punishedfor legally and ethically telling the truth, or the$100 billion in taxpayer fundsawarded to war profiteers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing every year. With better civilian oversight of taxpayer funds, we could implement a universal healthcare system that is not only ethically and morally just, but aKoch brothers funded study found will save money in the long run. Empowering the electorate with transparent, free, and honest elections is the foundation upon which progress is made. Let’s look at how technology will help us in the process. To explain the basic structure of a blockchain, think literally of the words ‘block’ and ‘chain’. In computer terminology, a block is a ‘piece of text processed as a unit’. A blockchain is literally a long string of computer code, with piece after piece ‘chained’ together. In isolation, this is nothing more than a growing ledger of information. The advantage blockchains offer is operating peer-to-peer with no central database. This means every network user reads and writes to the exact same blockchain, also called a distributed ledger. Imagine a giant typewriter, with everybody able to access the keyboard and add their text one at a time. There is just one piece of paper, constantly getting longer. Anything typed onto the paper is permanent and unalterable. This is known as immutability and is one of the most important facets of blockchain technology. Another key function is that blockchains incorporate cryptography through hashing,most oftenSHA256. This is the act of applying mathematical functions to text, ensuring that only the correct cryptographic key can decipher it. In this way, there are different ‘private keys’ that unlock the ability to access specific parts of a blockchain, known as a ‘public address’, but there is no ‘master key’ that can access everything. This use of decentralized cryptographic networks shifts us from earlier paradigms of law and order. In more chaotic times, the sword was law and disputes were settled by force. As civilization advanced, word became law, and through democratic elections, the populace began to shape legal frameworks. However, words are still open to interpretation by lawyers, and unjust legal practicesoften apply the law unequally. Distributed ledgers offer many advantages of a trustless system where the code is law. To show how this operates, let’s look at the first and most famous blockchain, Bitcoin. Bitcoin (also written BTC) started in 2009 with a single block being ‘mined’ by the creator, to this day known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Mining is when computers on the decentralized network solve the encryption hash to create the next block of BTC and write the network transactions onto the blockchain. Anyone can view any address or transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain by running the network software, or viewing a ‘block explorer’ website such asblockchain.com. By reading the ledger backward, you can trace every fraction of BTC through every transaction back to its origin. For instance, you can view the genesis block at000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f, where 50 BTC was created at ‘Block #0’ and sent to the public address1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. This wallet still holds 66.90222543 BTC, and only the person who created this public address (Satoshi in this case) was given the private key necessary to send these BTC to another address. Because the Bitcoin software is open-source, anyone can view and verify the integrity of the software, with no vulnerability or ‘backdoor’. Any change in the open-source code requires a consensus of the decentralized network of miners and users, meaning changes in the code are hotly debated. Bitcoin operates peer-to-peer and encrypted, with full immutability, meaning no individual, company, or country can alter or censor it. This decentralization also allows transactions to happen safely with no trust in other users or a third party required, and double spend transactions are prevented. Bitcoin also has acontrolled supplywritten into its code, with over 17 million BTC currently available and new BTC creation slowing until a finite number of 21 million BTC. This is a stark contrast to traditional fiat currencies such as the Dollar, Euro, or Pound, which can be printed at any time. While sometimes slowed by heavy network usage, the Bitcoin network once processed a transactionvalued at 300 million dollars for just 4 cents in a matter of minutes. Using the international banking standard SWIFT costs $15–35 dollars, takes 1–2 days minimum, and cannot be used independently of banks. Because discussion of Bitcoin inevitably turns to prices, I will state simply that early technologies see many price increases and corrections, and it’s best to look beyond this. The internet was not abandoned after Pets.com went bankrupt and Amazon lost 90% of its value in 2000. In 9 years, BTC has exponentially risen from pennies to dollars, from hundreds to thousands, dropping by more than 50% over 8 times, and it is the first generation of new technology. While I must move on, there is much to discuss regarding Bitcoin, including that an estimated3–4 million BTCwill never be accessed due to lost private keys, protecting the network fromquantum computersthat may one day break SHA256 encryption,how ‘forks’ happenwhen the network users disagree on updates to the source code, and digital currency competitors that offer faster, cheaper, or fully untraceable payments. To understand how most of the following examples utilize blockchain technology, it’s first necessary to introduce the concept of ‘smart contracts.’ Thousands of blockchain-based ‘cryptocurrencies’ have been created, expanding the capabilities of blockchain and distributed ledgers. While many simply focus on payments and transfer of value, whether faster, cheaper, easier, or anonymous, a growing number are utilizing distributed ledger technology in creative ways. Ethereum,EOS, and other infrastructure cryptocurrencies have code scripting that can be deployed by users. This allows the creation of smart contracts, which are immutable code placed on a blockchain, stipulating what parameters must be met for an action to take place automatically — a permanent and secure ‘if-this-then-that’ statement operating on a decentralized system. Where Bitcoin revolutionized the ability for censorship-proof exchange of value with no middle-man, smart contracts allow for distributed computer networks to run decentralized applications, known as ‘DApps’. In this way, no trusted third party is necessary for an agreement to be made between two users, with any form of digital data being stored or exchanged upon specific code being processed. This is where blockchain technology expands its real-world utilization, and the possibilities are fantastic. Unsurprisingly, numerous cryptocurrencies are focused on the exchange of money or goods. In addition to payment channels, there are blockchain-based companies integrating stocks and securities exchange, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies pegged to assets such as publicly traded stocks, gold, silver or various national currencies. This breaks down barriers of entry and eliminates brokerages and banks as middlemen. Some cryptocurrency exchanges are even fully decentralized, requiring no centralized system of accounts, passwords, or databases, allowing users to keep control of their traded assets locally. Projects such asHumaniqare working to help members of developing nations who are largely unbanked, bringing beneficiaries out of poverty through financial independence.Mannais a non-profit that’s created a Universal Basic Income available to anyone and distributed through their blockchain. Other companies use smart contracts to‘tokenize’ real-world assets, such as land and home ownership, art and high-value objects, wills and legal agreements, even electricity usage, and carbon credits. By operating on a distributed ledger, owners can hold the private key or pass legal ownership of assets independently. Agreements can be coded into a smart-contract, eliminating the need for lawyers, making arbitration simpler and cheaper, and ensuring stipulations of the agreement are enforced by immutable code. Further, private or government-run blockchains can provide legal frameworks that are fully transparent, automated, and secure. The Republic of Georgia is currently testing just such a program: “By building a blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent, and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.” — Papuna Ugrekhelidze, the Chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia “By building a blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent, and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.” — Papuna Ugrekhelidze, the Chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia Because most distributed ledgers are fully transparent and all transactions are traceable and immutable, corruption and misuse of funds can also be addressed this way. Spain has committed to buildingEU-wide blockchain and AI applicationsto fight corruption in the EU single market, and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) isreplacing its current systemwith blockchain technology to cut transaction costs, improve security, and fight fraud. If a government truly wanted all taxpayer funding to be appropriated transparently, a blockchain-based system could audit every penny quickly and easily. Funds paid to contractors, employees, or government programs could be monitored with complete trust and any corruption, bribery, or misuse of funds would be easily identified. Complete transparency and the prevention of fraud is also needed in the global supply chain of goods, where the negative impact of counterfeit goods and piracy are estimated in the trillions, with$200 billion lost annuallyto counterfeit medicines alone. Tamper-proof packaging with a blockchain-based tracking system that can independently verify the origin, shipping, and handling of medicines will save lives, money, and establish trust between producers, handlers, and consumers. Numerous startups all over the world are competing to secure contracts for their supply-chain ecosystems,IBM is building its own supply-chain blockchain, andDHL has partnered with a blockchain companyto track pharmaceuticals from origin to purchase. It’s no surprise that tech companies like Facebook and Google have large amounts of data on users, butrecent revelationsthat Facebook literally gave Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify access to hundreds of millions of users’ private messages expands the scope of unethical use of user data. In the new interconnected global economy, data is currency, but everyday users are left out of the equation. Companies like 23andMe have become popular by mapping your DNA, but there is the caveat that they are able tosell your biological dataonce it has been ‘de-identified’. Companies such asCivicare using blockchain security to create secure identity login systems with the user in complete control.The Unification Foundation, a company I helped incubate in its early development this past year, is finalizing development of a blockchain-based protocol to standardize data across industries and give consumers full control of every data point. This lets users visualize, manage, and even monetize the data they create, all secured through a decentralized encrypted network they have the keys to. Startups focused on DNA testing, insurance and coverage, medical records, and clinical trial matching are all working to bring ownership of medical data back to consumers. The ability to truly own and control access to your online, medical, and financial data is paramount to personal freedom. Another important use for distributed ledgers is in structural systems of communication and file storage. The ability to communicate freely, without censorship or surveillance, is rapidly being lost. In China, it’s estimated that over30,000 people are employed as ‘Internet Police’, monitoring websites and personal chats for dissenting opinions to censor, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or criticisms of President Xi. In the USA, the National Security Agency (NSA) has collected massive amounts of data on its citizensgoing back to the 1960s, with revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden showing just how pervasive current surveillance is. Projects such asAdamantandMercury Protocolallow for completely decentralized, censorship-proof, anonymous communication and data transfers. This allows the creation of truly secure data transmission for users as well as applications themselves. Decentralized file storage systems such asIPFSallow users to securely and permanently store or share data. In Thailand, an activistuploaded an anti-government songby Rap Against Dictatorship onto the IPFS storage system, then used the anonymous cryptocurrency ZCoin to safely share the link. The ZCoin blockchain at block111089permanently displays the IPFS link, mXFf5QLQi3DhbwyrgR7qH8tHAZcGyWtWtsBy6iij4B7aL, which can be used to access the song. The ability to safely and anonymous share information that cannot be censored is incredibly important. In 2018,53 journalists were murdered, andat least 251 imprisonedworldwide. Perhaps one of the strongest ways blockchain technology can help secure a stable and free society is through voting systems. In the USA, elections are handled by local and state officials, which has many advantages of not centralizing electoral authority or providing a single failure point. However, this means that there is little consistency between states regarding method of voting, paper trails, or voter identification laws. One major issue in the USA is the use of voting machines. Numerous studies have shown that the machines areseverely at riskof tampering and hacking, and one vendor admitted toinstalling backdoor softwareinto the voting machines. Some states use Direct Recording Electronic voting systems, storing the votes on a hard drive, but haveno form of paper trail backup. Voting on a blockchain system would mean that at the time of submission, a voter could view the literal code being input to verify its contents. Voters could be provided a transparent record of votes cast while protecting their, and also providing voters with a decryption key to verify that their vote on the blockchain is correct. Voter registration could be standardized and secure, errors, operating costs, and fraud could all be dramatically reduced by utilizing bio-metric verification of voters. The nation ofSouth Korea,a political party in Thailand,a city in Japan, and theUS state of West Virginiahave all begun trialing blockchain-based voting systems. In the USA, states that have ballot initiatives and direct issue voting could hold secure real-time voting on a variety of measures. Some states have already begun to adopt election methodology other than the first-past-the-post electoral system which results in only two major parties over time, a phenomenon known asDuverger’s Law. Integrating safe and secure technology into our voting systems can help the push for more fair and democratic election methods such asranked-choice voting, where voters rank their choices and an automated run-off system determines the most preferred candidate. Human beings are wired for connection. However, we also require privacy, protection, and individuality. As technology brings us together on a global scale, we must ensure that the general population regains control of the structural foundations that our interconnected world is built upon. This applies to communication, finances, personal data, elections, and much more. We are on the cusp of a fully connected and decentralized internet that incorporates not only our phones and computers but increasing numbers of devices in the Internet of Things. We must ensure that the structural systems of communication are transparent, free, and uncensored. And most importantly, empowering ourselves with technology can empower society collectively through transparent code-based agreements, uncensored speech and journalism, secure personal data, and direct democracy that is secure and fair.

De este modo, los antivirus trabajan con una gran base de datos integrada por los ciberataques que se han desarrollado con anterioridad, al tiempo que también repelen acciones similares en forma o alcance. No obstante, la imaginación de loshackerses proporcional a su capacidad para causar daños, yendo siempre un paso por delante de nuestros escudos pasivos. Por ello, cada vez más empresas apuestan por la protección activa que representan los “cazadores de ciberamenazas”. La agencia SANS ha publicado un exhaustivo estudio que pasa revista al grado de adopción de estos peculiares “cazadores” en el ámbito corporativo. Un nada desdeñable 43% de las empresas consultadas afirman utilizar con cierta frecuencia este tipo de servicios, al tiempo que un considerable 65% reconocen que invertirán más dinero en ellos en los próximos dos años. ¿Cuál fue el detonante de esta tendencia en ciberseguridad? El propio informe de SANS nos da la respuesta. El 49% de las compañías que participaron en el estudio se encontraron en algún momento con amenazas que sus sistemas de seguridad no podían identificar. Con todo, la actividad de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” no ha conseguido acabar todavía con algunos errores en materia de seguridadonlinemuy asentados. Por ejemplo, un 37% de las firmas analizadas por SANS no toman ninguna medida relevante hasta que sufren algún ataque. De este modo, la protección proactiva dista de ser un recurso extendido en el tejido empresarial norteamericano, a pesar de que los responsables de las compañías no discuten su interés. Para las grandes empresas, resulta imposible conjurar los riesgos en línea si no disponen de herramientas totalmente adaptadas a su modelo de negocio. La caza de amenazas no puede automatizarse por completo. Los profesionales que se dedican a la caza de ciberamenazas trabajan con un gran número de variables a fin de detectar si están ante un nuevo tipo de ataque o si, simplemente, se trata de un repunte coyuntural de la actividad delictiva. Dentro de este segundo grupo de amenazas encontraríamos el aumento de las acciones durante los periodos en que la empresa registra más operaciones (durante las campañas comerciales, por ejemplo). Los modelos más avanzados de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” permiten cribar con rapidez los ataques para centrarse en las acciones más peligrosas.

From business class travel to chauffeured Mercedes-Benz limousine service, these scions of the semiconductor world were riding high on a wave of optimism and global consumption of smartphones hitherto unprecedented and unparalleled. But it seems that the party may be ending in the semiconductor-sphere and not just because of the looming trade war between the United States and China, but because of the laws of physics as well. For decades, Moore’s law, (which is really an observation and not alawin the strict sense), that every two years, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles. In other words, chips (not the potato kind) are expected to do more while getting smaller. But the reality has been far different. For the early decades of chip development, Moore’s “law” was actually observed more in its contravention than in its adherence. Chips were becoming faster and smaller at a rate far in excess of Moore’s observations. Think of transistors as tiny little ON/OFF switches, which allow small amounts of current to either pass through them or not. The more transistors a chip can store, the more calculations it can make and the faster these calculations can be made. The simple ON/OFF design and the combination thereof is what…",Patrick Tan,https://medium.com/@patricktankt/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--982498c9254a---------------------------------------,186,7 min read,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg|https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg,2019-01-03T14:47:51.906Z,Medium
https://medium.com/@easytimetracking/10-reasons-why-social-media-marketing-is-indispensable-for-your-business-today-cf9264df31bb?source=tag_archive---------181-----------------------,10 Reasons Why Social Media Marketing is Indispensable for Your Business Today.,Written byDaniel Bernard,"Daniel Bernard Follow -- Listen Share Social Media is one of the most powerful tools in the marketing sector today. It has created a platform and foundation that will allow all types of companies to share their creative work and get recognized globally. Therefore, we have compiled 10 reasons to help you understand how social media can effectively grow your business and get you new customers. 1. Brand Awareness— When you post on Facebook about the brand, almost anyone in the world can view it and engage with your post. This opens the gateway to so many opportunities and prospective customers. 2. Increase in Sales— This is the most sought-after consequence for business owners after they make their brand presence known on social media. New prospective customers in and around the local area get to know about your brand and will choose to try out your brand. If it is e-commerce, then you will have a lot of requests for shipping from abroad or local areas. It will depend on your brand category or your industry. However, it will surely contribute to more sales. 3. Better Understanding of the marketplace— Once your brand gets recognized on social media, you will start to understand the marketplace better. You will get more awareness about your competitors, the current trends as well as the general overview of the demand and supply of the products/services. This will assist you in refining your product/service and empower you to sell better and create an overall pleasant experience. 4. New ideas— By interacting with customers online and getting valuable insights from data, you will be able to get new ideas for your current product/service or maybe even about a whole new different product. Ideas come from a variety of new experiences and that’s exactly what the social media promises. 5. Accountability— Social media gives you accurate data and if you are running ads, then you will be able to track more closely. By using this data, you can fine-tune your marketing strategies as well as proactively make changes to your customer support and service. 6. Customer Satisfaction— Companies have been able to respond to customer’s query better on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Social media allows for instant replies and decreases the response time between the customer and company. This will save time for both the company and the customer plus actions can easily be taken and this results in a good system for customer support which indeed adds to customer satisfaction. 7. Cost effective— You can create a twitter or a Facebook account for free and a Facebook business page is also zero cost. This will help you to create valuable and high-quality content which you can share with your followers. Just a tip: People always appreciate good content, so deliver the same and you will get good reach in no time. 8. Monitor and Control— It is easy and effortless to control and maintain your social media account. In this way, you can always monitor, edit, repost and engage without much apprehension because you are always in control of your account. In addition to this, social media is accessible and portable. You can take care of your brand’s social media account from any corner of the world. 9. Opportunities— Your brand’s enhanced social presence is surely going to attract new opportunities for you. It may appear in any form- as business opportunities or a lot of new customer opportunities. Example: You are a caterer. A customer in the local area looks up on Facebook for ‘caterers’. Your brand name pops up with several 5-star reviews and tons of Facebook page likes. The prospective customer will take a look at the page and contact you for further details. This can happen in many ways for various types of industries. 10. Launch products/services— After creating a solid follower base, you can get to launch products/services directly on social media networks (live or not). This will create a ripple of engagement with your present customers, attract new customers and help your brand gain a lot of attention. Also, this will direct a lot of traffic towards your website and in the end, result in more sales. These are some of the crucial reasons as to why social media will make your business more prosperous and better.

https://medium.com/tourradar/why-i-joined-tourradar-ccbde8237762?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,Why I Joined TourRadar,"As the company’s first VP of Engineering, here’s why I decided to be a part of this growing travel-tech startup.","As the company’s first VP of Engineering, here’s why I decided to be a part of this growing travel-tech startup. Paulo André Follow TourRadar -- Listen Share When I landed in Berlin in the early hours of 2015, I had no idea what was in store for me. Almost four years later, I look back on a journey of massive personal development, thanks to the rollercoaster that is working at a hyper-growth technology startup. Throughout my time at HelloFresh, change was the only constant; my role kept morphing every few months, even if the job title sometimes didn’t. The company quickly went from startup to scale-up and being an early employee on the tech team — eventually moving up to a Director of Engineering role — gave me the opportunity to amass a lot of experience in many areas: technical leadership, hiring and firing, performance management, organisational design… the list goes on. But eventually, the time came when I felt my personal growth was no longer aligned with the company’s growth and I knew I had to move on. Being ambitious — and sometimes a little too eager — I wanted to leverage all the learnings by taking a shot at leading an engineering organisation within a smaller startup looking to scale up. I yearned to be given the trust to build a world-class engineering team. With this in mind, I started opening my ears to all the executive recruiting approaches I was getting, engaging with those I found interesting. That’s how TourRadar soon popped up on my radar and, once I went through the whole interviewing process, I had a decision to make. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company as their first VP of Engineering. So why did I joinTourRadar? Solving an Unsolved Problem The first thing that got me excited about TourRadar was that it seemed to be solving a problem that had not yet been truly solved — bringing multi-day touring online, a business that for the longest time was done through brick and mortar travel agencies. I quickly realised the challenges in selling this type of product online had to be very significant: a marketplace model, with high basket sizes and multiple touch points on and off-site. No wonder it was being touted as the “last frontier” of online travel. The fact that travelling, especially for longer periods of time, can be transformative, coupled with the technical and business challenges I could perceive, made the company’s vision of “connecting people to life-enriching travel experiences” one I felt compelled to work for. And from a business perspective, it became obvious that solving this challenge at scale, with no real incumbent in sight, could mean massive upside in a global, multi-billion dollar industry. People Naval Ravikantonce said of choosing a co-founder: “If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.” “If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.” While it may be a bit exaggerated, I think there’s a lot of truth to this. Working on interesting problems is only truly rewarding when you do it alongside great people that bring out the best in you. It was therefore important to me, throughout the hiring process to try and figure out whether I saw myself working with the people at the company. As I was interviewing for an executive role, and thanks to a well-designed interview process, I had the chance to talk to multiple people in the organisation. I felt somehow immediately connected to the leadership team, to whom I was asked to do a presentation, and was appreciative of the fact that they all gathered to attend my presentation live, including those in Canada and Australia at odd hours of their day (or night). As for the engineering team, to whom I also gave a talk on a topic of my choice, they listened closely and proceeded to grill me on different subjects, which I really enjoyed as it showed they were genuinely curious and truly invested in their work. Overall, what struck me is that everyone asked really great questions. The clincher on the people side was talking to two board members. Instead of selling me the company, they sold me the challenge, and that made all the difference. It was encouraging to see the company being backed by very experienced people, with their feet firmly planted on the ground, but obviously believing (and invested) in the company’s long-term success. Skill Fit My time at HelloFresh exposed me to many stages of growth and scale, something that I imagined made me an interesting prospect for TourRadar. The way I understood the role of VP of Engineering, the company was looking to scale up given their clear product-market fit. This, for me, meant working hard at setting up a tech platform that would enable TourRadar to scale its operations as smoothly as possible and continue on a strong growth trajectory. When thinking about what goes into building this platform, more than executing anything hands-on, I believe the VP of Engineering role is about creating an environment where excellent execution takes place. This means hiring the best and best-suited talent for the company’s goals, developing the people already on board and maximising their potential, designing the tech org in a way that reduces friction and promotes agility and flow, ensuring we are collectively building the right tech stack, and so on. All of these I was exposed to, at scale, at my previous role. Personal Growth While I would definitely have opportunities to improve existing skills, I could also see myself being pushed way out of my comfort zone — which would be crucial for my personal growth. To name a few examples, it would be the first time… being directly accountable to a CEO (and co-founder) being part of an executive leadership team coming in from the outside to lead an entire engineering org having no tech person “above” me working in the travel business (and a marketplace model) living in Austria Some trepidation aside, all things considered, the opportunity was just too good to pass up. It also helped that when discussing it with a mentor of mine I got nothing but encouragement. And in any case, I knew that if I worked hard, focused on asking the right questions, and connected with mentors outside the company, things would be alright and I would be able to really grow a lot in the process. When thinking about the next steps in your career, it is important to understand that interviewing is a two-way process — companies interview you as much as you are interviewing them. However, without a clear idea of what matters most to you next, it becomes quite difficult to suss out those things in a future employer. For me, the ability to have a significant impact in a high-potential business, with a challenge that pushes me beyond my current abilities while working with great people is the “superformula” I was looking for, and I can’t wait to see what 2019 has in stock for us.

Aman Mittal Follow Level Up Coding -- 12 Listen Share We live in the world of a variety of mobile devices majorly dominated by two platforms, iOS, and Android. It is a two-horse race and I am sure we can all agree on that. Building a mobile application is not an easy task though. For iOS, you write code using Objective-C or Swift and for Android, you will find yourself using Java. Apart from different programming languages used to create a mobile that can run on each of the two platforms, the toolchains are entirely different too for both of these mobile platforms. Many modern-day developers use a specific set of technology that is used to build web applications: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are different frameworks that fall under the category commonly known as Hybrid applications. You can use almost one set of source code for developing the application for both iOS and Android platforms. In recent years, hybrid frameworks have evolved coming from web view to use native APIs. This cross-platform approach of developing a mobile application comes with its own pros and cons. Pros such as being less-time consuming and cost-effective and cons include performance issues. One great option that falls under the umbrella of cross-platform development is React Native. Developed and used by Facebook as well others such as Tesla, Walmart, Uber Eats, Instagram, Discord, Wix and so on. React Native is based on Facebook’s web library ReactJS. Learn React Native - Best React Native Tutorials (2019) | gitconnected The top 21 React Native tutorials - learn React Native for free. Courses are submitted and voted on by developers… gitconnected.com In this tutorial, you will learn the following things: What is React Native? Setting up the Development Environment Use React Native CLI Run a React Native App What is App.js? Hot Reloading AppRegistry Build your first React Native App Learn about different UI components ViewComponent StyleSheetObject TextComponent Create a list withFlatList Learning Path for React Native In a nutshell, React Native allows you to build mobile applications that look, feel and perform much more like native applications. It uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React. Good thing for developers is that they can use almost the same concepts that are being used for building web applications. If you are familiar with Reactjs or come from front-end development background, React uses a virtual DOM which acts as a shadow to real DOM available. When an element changes, that change is reflected on the real DOM by Virtual DOM using a node that corresponds to each element. However, in React Native, there is no DOM rather than Native Components which are provided by platforms such as iOS and Android. There are no web views here. React Native has an instance ofJavaScriptCoreto execute JS code when an application starts. React Native uses RCTBridgeModule to make a connection between native code and JavaScript code. In simple words, React Native brings the React to mobile app development. Its goal isn’t to write the code once and run it on any platform. The main goal here is to learn once and write-anywhere. An important distinction to make. React Native is still relatively new, as at the time of writing this post, it is in its version0.57. To dive deeply in React Native’s ecosystem, we need to install a few things first to get started. Let us go through one of them. Nodejs & Watchman React Native uses Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to build your JavaScript code. If you do not already have Node.js installed, it’s time to get it from its official websitehere. I recommend installing LTS (long-term support)10.x.xversion which is also I am using personally. Watchman is a tool developed by Facebook for watching file changes. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance. For Mac users, You will need thehomebrewmacOS package to installwatchman:brew install watchman. For Windows users, there is nowatchmanso you can skip this step but you need to have Nodejs as well aspython2as React Native's recent version requires it. Lastly, everyone (irrespective of the OS you are using) need to install theJava SE Development Kit (JDK) that can be foundhere. Make sure the version you install is at least or more than>= 8. Native SDKs For macOS developers, you can install Xcode which is free to develop iOS applications. If you want to develop for Android, setting up its development environment can be a bit tedious if you are new to this. You will be installingAndroid Studiowhich is a completely free tool to develop Android apps in its native language. You will be installing a list of utilities for this process and then setting path variables for the first time, so I am recommending to go through the exact linkherewhich are official setup instructions provided by Facebook. Once you are done with the development environment setup process and necessary tools, you can take a deep breath right now. We are going to start building our first REACT NATIVE APP. In order to start, we need one more tool. Usingnpm(a package manager,which you installed using Node.js) you are now going to installreact-native-cli. Open your terminal and run the following command. This CLI tool is used to scaffold a starter project containing everything you need to build and run a React Native app.npminstalls this CLI tool as aglobal module. To verify that the installation process was a success, you can run the command below and it will output you the current version of the CLI tool. To get started we need to create a project directory using the CLI tool just installed. Open up your terminal and run the following. You can name it whatever you want. Once the process is done, traverse inside the project directory. You will be welcomed by a set of files like below. From above let us now take a brief look at the files or directories that are essential for us to understand: App.jsthe first file in any React Native app that is the entry point of the app development process. Whatever you write inside this file, it will get displayed on the mobile device. node_modules/is a folder which contains all the dependencies (or packages) that are used to develop and run this application. index.jsis the entry point to trigger the app on a device or simulator iosis the folder containing an Xcode project and the code required to bootstrap this app for iOS devices androidis the folder containing android related code to bootstrap this app for Android devices package.jsonwhere every dependency installed gets listed You can ignore the other files as of now. Thereact-native-clitool comes with some default snippets of code. To see it in action, you will have to run the application using a terminal. I am going to use an iOS simulator and an Android emulator for this purpose. Windows developers can ignore the iOS part. Do note that, we have not made any changes in the source code of the application. To run the app, we need to trigger the below command first. This will start the metro bundler to watch for any file changes in a.jsfile in your project. Make sure this command is running in a separate terminal window or a tab when you are building your project foriOSorAndroid. Running on iOS To run the app with whatever current content it has on an iOS simulator, you can run the following command below in the second terminal window. This command builds your app and starts it on iOS simulator. This process consumes some good amount of time when building the necessary iOS files for the first time for any React Native app. It will also open up a simulator device for you like below when the process is done. This iOS simulator is the default one with current Xcode version you have. However, you can run any sim device by adding a flag. By running the command:xcrun simctl list devicesyou can check out which devices you have available as simulators. The lastBootedorShutdownagainst each listed device in above image tells you which devices are currently running. To build and run for another device, you can run the following command. where""iPhone 8 Plus""is the value that you can look up through the last command I mentioned. Running on Android You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer. If you wish to run it on a real device, you can follow the complete set of instructionshere.For running on an Android emulator, open the Android Studio, and choose the option to ‘open an existing project/folder’. Once the project gets opened and is indexed, you will see an icon looking exactly like below image in the right corner. This is an option for enabling an Android Virtual Device (AVD). If you have just installed Android Studio, you will likely need to create a new AVD. After the virtual device is running, you can run the commandreact-native run-androidfrom your terminal window to open up the application. To see the app in action on both the devices, let us modifyApp.jswith the code below. The result of the following modification can be seen if you pressCmd + Ron iOS and doubleRon Android. Hot Reloading feature in react native application helps to display any updates occur in UI, whenever you save anything in react native app-code. On enabling this feature, you do not have to pressCmd + Ron iOS and doubleRon Android again for seeing the changes on the UI you just made. To enable this feature, all you have to do is pressCtrl + M/Cmd + Mdepending on your OS, and selectEnable Hot Reloadingfrom the popup menu that appears as shown above. The file that renders this App component isindex.jsin the root directory which has the following code. AppRegistryis the entry point to run a React Native application. App component or any other root component in the app should register by usingAppRegistry.registerComponentsuch that the native system can load the bundle of the app and run the app by startingAppRegistry.runApplication. You can read more aboutAppRegistryin-detailhere. In this section, you are going to build your first React Native app. To get started, we have already generated a React Native project using the cli tool. The only thing now you have to understand iswhat are components? Componentsare the visual elements that you see on the screen in a React Native app. There are several components made available for you to use by the React Native core. To understand this better, we can categorize these components in six broad categories: Basic or Core components such asView,Text,Image,ScrollView,TextInput,StyleSheet List components such asFlatListandSectionList User Interface or Form Control components such asPicker,Slider,Button,Switch iOS Specific components such asActionSheetIOS,SegmentedControlIOS,AlertIOS,PushNotificationsIOS Android Specific components such asDatePickerAndroid,TimePickerAndroid,ViewPagerAndroid,ToastAndroid,PermissionsAndroid Other/Miscellaneous components such asAlert,Animated,CameraRoll,Dimensions,Clipboard,StatusBar,Linking,Keyboard,ActivityIndicator,WebView, andModal Getting in detail about each of them is out of the scope of this article and will be a tedious way to learn things initially. Instead, we are going to use a project-based approach to learn your way through them. There are many more components and APIs available in React Native core that you can look at theofficial documentationand from time to time you will need to. You are going to build a small application to just familiarize yourself with basic components. The app is shown in the image below is going to be the end result. The above is nothing but a list of text coming directly from the component’s state. Create a newsrc/componentsdirectory in the root of the project and insidecomponents/create a new file calledEmojiDict.jswith the following snippet of code. Accordingly, we have to modifyApp.jsfile in order to display the result of this component. Now if you take a look at the simulator screen you will see the following result. What is going on?Take a look at theEmojiDictfile first. We are importing basic components from React Native. We start by declaring aViewcomponent, which is the basic building block in React Native file. It maps to fundamental native iOS (UIView) and Android (View) components, hence the name. You can think this component as meredivelement from HTML where all other elements are placed inside. Hence, aViewcomponent can contain nested components. Viewcomponent puts a container element that supports layout styling withflexboxand other styles through CSS. We are providing styles to View viaStyleSheet. Hence, you can say thatViewcomponents are primarily used for styling and layout of children elements. StyleSheetin React Native provides an API to create styles inside the component file. It takes a JavaScript object as it does above, and returns a newStylesheetobject from it. There are noclassesoridsin React Native like in web development. To create a new style object you useStyleSheet.create()method. The way we have defined styles by creating an object is the preferred way. Not only it helps you organize styles and keep them separate, but these styles when defined in this manner are also sent through the native render bridge only once. TheTextcomponent is in many ways just like theViewcomponent, except that it is specifically available to display text. Also, like theViewcomponent, it supports styling. Right now we are usingflexboxto style and center the anything inside theViewcomponent.Flexboxis an algorithm to specify the layout for a component for its children to follow the same pattern. Suppose if we modify it as below: You will get the following result on refreshing the simulator. The way we are creating a list of emojis isn’t a pragmatic approach to handle data whether it comes from a third party API or manage by the component’s state and render it as a list as we do above. Let us convert our simple view intoFlatList. FlatListis cross-platform, by default vertical way to display a list of data items. It requires two props:dataandrenderItem.datais the source of information for the list.renderItemtakes one item from the source and returns a formatted component to render. Styles that can be applied to aFlatListcomponent is done by the propcontentContainerStylethat accepts the value ofStylesheetobject. What we have above is the simplest version of flatlist. Moreover, FlatList in React Native has support to pull to refresh interaction and horizontal display mode. This completes our first React Native App. I am sure, you might have learned a thing or two. It is a just a basic component that renders a list of items. With lack of up to date resources or not many resources you will find on React Native concretely, I urge to stick with you learn by doing process and get as much as hands on experience in this field as you can. I did struggle when I started learning React Native, coming from a Web Development background. Here is what I think you can do to advance with React Native development. This article just provides you with an overview of what inside the React Native app development process and how things work behind the scenes, briefly. I often come across (especially through#100DaysOfCodecampaign) developers who struggle to learn a new framework with little no background in specific the programming language. My advice, before you leap to make gigantic projects, start with the basics. Learn the concepts as each specific component to the curve, make sure to apply them as much as you can and build small things. For example, today learned about usingFlatListcomponent in this article. Try creating a list with your own dataset or find a mock/fake data set on the internet and try to build a small app out of it. Always remember the feeling you got from creating your firstHello Worldprogram. Do you remember that sense of accomplishment? Take small steps, build small things at first before dip your toes deep in the complexity of state management libraries such as Redux and Mobx, or persisting data, using third party APIs, using TypeScript or Flow, and so on. These are just tools, you do not need to know them on day one (but I am not saying you have to never learn about them. The keyword here is that they are TOOLS). If you are new to JavaScript, make sure you are clear with the basic ES6 features such as classes, arrow functions etc. Then, you must go through the basic ReactJS concepts such as props, state, and stateless components in general. In summary, take a look at: ES6 Features ReactJS Components API Setting up a development environment for React Native Flexbox Once you have basic concepts clear in your mind and have played around a bit to get some amount of hands-on experience, it is time to advance further. Start building bigger apps that work or behave like a real application and interact with real-time data. Here is a list of things you can learn to advance in your journey. Offline data storage withAsyncStorage Working with third-party APIs Maps Splash Screens Navigation Redux (for state management) Redux Saga and Persist Tests and TDD Push notifications UI Animations Build and publish your app Continuous Delivery or CI Do note that, these are just broad topics to get you started. There are many other things you will learn along the way. Don’t get overwhelmed by that. Maybe you to become professional a React Native developer and work in an organization that uses this tech framework or maybe you want to build apps for your clients/customers. Setting your own personal challenges in the way is a great way to learn. Make a commitment to yourself and work on it. Find apps on your phone or on stores that you want to clone or add an extra feature as a functionality, or learn about the user interface. Do not get overwhelmed by the number of mistakes you do or the errors you get. Getting frustrated and ranting/complaining about it over the internet all day is easy but understand this is that, it will not solve your problems or make you a better developer. All of this is a part of your journey. Keep reminding yourself that. If you are getting started in React Native development, let us do this together.

Something about the bright, flashing colors just makes electronic dance music all the more fun to bop along to — or however you’re supposed to dance these days. Breakdancing or something, maybe? Anyway, if that’s your thing,Amy Goodchild’s awesome tutorialwill walk you through how to build an interactive FadeCandy LED dome that’s perfect for your next dance party. When in Domeis a 4.2 meter (about 14 foot) geodesic dome with the interior covered in 4,378 individually-addressable LEDs. I imagine that dancing inside the dome probably makes one feel like they’ve been transported into a David Guettamusic video. Goodchild designed and builtWhen in Domeas the final project for her Master’s degree in Design for Performance and Interactive at the Interactive Architecture Lab of the University College London Bartlett School of Architecture. Goodchild has also made the plans available, so you can build your own! The structure of the geodesic dome is constructed using a hub kit fromBuild with Hubs, which is designed specifically to be easy to assemble. The finished dome is made up of 33 triangular panels, and those are split into 11 sets of three panels each. Each set of three gets 512 LEDs and oneAdafruit FadeCandy LED controller. Programming the LED controllers is where it gets quite complicate, but Goodchild provides a thorough explanation.

https://medium.com/@sarahhubbard/2018-a-year-in-review-7d6d1177066b?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,2018: A Year in Review,The Bigger Things of 2018,"Sarah Hubbard Follow -- Listen Share Traveled to ten countries. Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC. Woah — this is thefifth editionof my year in review!! (See2014,2015,2016,2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones! I created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days, usually mid-work week, but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out: I’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year, but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms, morning + afternoon coffees), coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah, sometimes making dinner, and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much, but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like: The Bigger Things of 2018 A huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here, I was able to switch over to another team, Azure IoT, that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews, interviews, wrapping up work, starting new work, everything falling apart, starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However, it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive, challenging, fast-paced, and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here. The other big life change was getting a French Bulldog puppy, named Ollie (@olliethefrenchiepup), with Josiah. Ollie has become such a huge part of both our lives and I have so much love for our little fam. It’s really the first time another being has depended on me and my actions — there has definitely been a shift towards more deeply understanding the responsibility of providing for another life. Puppy training has been frustrating at times, but all worth the work. One day this fall, Ollie had a terrible seizure, and we rushed him to the emergency hospital immediately. It was one of the most frightening moments I’ve experienced. We believe he has epilepsy, which has added to our caregiving responsibilities. Josiah and Ollie are such a big part of my life, daily routines to the park and lounging on the couch together, it’s hard to imagine life now without our little pup. Overall, what I find myself most anxious about is this constant pressure I put on myself to have all the answers. Sometimes it feels like there are so many things I want to do, but not enough time in this lifetime to do them all. It feels like age 30 is some sort of looming deadline to have life figured out — starting a family, doing work that is fulfilling, being successful and happy, and settling down in one place. Although I’m making progress towards these goals I care about, it still feels like a ticking clock. I can’t help but mull-over all the possible paths I could take — should I go to grad school (if so, for what) or work somewhere different or move somewhere international or sell everything and go backpack around — sometimes it feels like there are a lot of doors open and closed at the same time. I’m not exactly sure what I want my dream career to be or where I see myself 5 or 10 years from now. As more of my friends from high school are engaged, married, or have kids, it makes me feel old and like I should have my whole life figured out by now. I end up reminding myself that each year when I write these posts, more happens in life each year than you can ever predict, opportunities arise, and tragedy strikes. I have to remember that as long as the actions I take keep aligning towards my principles or north star, the answers figure themselves out along the way. Plus, as much as I crave answers, I’d much prefer figuring out ambiguity and am learning to let go of this need for control. I’m starting to practice that instead of “analysis paralysis” or trying to keep all these options open, making a big decision and then jumping in and rolling with it, feels so much better. Favorite show:The Newsroom (older show, just watched) Favorite movies:The Post &BlackkKlansman Favorite failure:I really wanted to work on the Mixed Reality team— I took Unity classes for months, interview prepped, went to Seattle VR meetups, and tried out all the devices. I interviewed for a position I really thought I had and didn’t get it. When I finally got a different position it got cut the week I joined. I was crushed to work so hard for something and see it crumble as soon as I had it in my hands. Looking back, it all worked out in the end. Here are a few (mostly chronological) highlights from 2018: Rahil came to visit! We went snowshoeing and drove up to explore Vancouver, Canada. Spent a week in Belize with Josiah’s family — hanging out in the beach town, snorkeling with sharks, and learning to fish.I wrote more about our Belize trip here. Went to the mountains for a few weekend trips. One girls trip to the Olympic Peninsula (with Puja, Alex, Caitlyn, and Annie) and another to Steven’s Pass for ski lessons. Brought my friends from Seattle to Austin, Texas, for the very first time. I love combining these places and people in the two places that are home. Took my first international work trip to Prague with Skype! Had the chance to also take side trips to Budapest (mostly by myself) and Vienna (with Austin) while there. Josiah and I joined Thomas, Kianna, and Philip, on the Greek islands for a week. We visited Santorini and Crete, ate gyros for just about every meal, and soaked up the sun next to crystal blue water. Raised Ollie with Josiah. Launched theAzure IoT Centralproduct. (This is a feature I worked on before the launch.) It was pretty stressful before the launch, working nights and some weekends, but it is exciting to be working in this space! Met up with my family in Cusco, Peru, and hiked the entire Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.I wrote more about this trip here.This was my first backpacking trip, first time in South America, and first wonder of the world! It was the most physically challenging, but breathtaking, trip I’ve ever taken and I really would love to do another hiking trip in 2019. Josiah and I moved into our new dream, modern apartment (right across the street from our apartment last year) right in downtown. I always dreamed as a girl I’d live in an apartment in the city and dress up everyday for a fancy job — I don’t realize it on a daily basis, but this is the kind of life I hoped to have when I was “older”, it just doesn’t feel like I’m the “older” girl I used to want to be. I’ve been trying to use the space to host and bring people together more! I can run a mile without stopping now, woohoo! Tried to get out and do some more hiking around WA this summer. Surprised Josiah and I with going on our first helicopter ride. Spoke at the Grace Hopper Conference in Houston at two different sessions. One session was at the Technical Executive Forum in front of a couple hundred C-Suite Execs on the Reverse-Mentoring Program I’ve been working on at Microsoft. The other session was a panel on Technology & Ethics with some incredible women! Josiah and I visited Thomas and Kianna in Bali, Indonesia, and stopped by Tokyo, Japan, along the way there. Josiah and I both thought this was probably the best trip we’d ever taken before. In Tokyo, we did an awesome Mario Cart racing in go-karts along the city streets. In Bali, we hung out at the beach, ate beautiful vegan foods, got massages, and motorbiked into the jungle to stay at an all-bamboo house.I wrote more about our Bali trip here. Right now, I’m writing this from Florida, where I’ve had the chance to soak up a bunch of family and sunshine! So happy to just relax with family — lazy days walking on the beach and watching Hallmark movies. Things I want to do in 2019: It’s starting to sink in that the concrete goals I set for myself, I tend to accomplish, and the vague ones show up year after year. I’m going to try to have fewer, concrete actions for 2019. I want to establish routine! The times I’m waking up/falling asleep, eating, working out, working hours etc. Routine automates good habits. Now that I’m in a solid position and team at work, I want to be promoted to PM II this year. I have a separate document with some of the concrete actions I’m going to take in the context of work to make that happen. I’m either going to take the GRE, GMAT, or figure out another way to start continuing education courses. I’m going to apply to some kind of continuing education program this year. Fitness is always on my list and even though I think I’ve made slow progress in this department, it still isn’t a habit. I’m going to workout at least 2-3 times a week. The one concrete goal I met was reading 15 books in 2018. My goal for 2019 is to read 20 books.I’ll be tracking this on Goodreads. I’m going to write a Medium post for every trip I take. I love looking back on these trip guides and they contain so much more detail than I can recall in hindsight. I had honestly never even heard of Azure IoT last year, and now I work there. I hadn’t planned on going to Machu Picchu anytime soon, and this year my family and I hiked for days to see the wonder of the world. I was excited to attend GHC for the first time last year, but had no idea I’d get the chance to speak there this year in front of hundreds of people. It’s astounding how little I could predict about 2018. And 2019 will undoubtedly bring the same unknowns. “The best part of the journey is the surprise and wonder along the way” - Ken Poirot Thank you for being a part of my journey. Here’s to filling 2019 with life and love.

People are constantly looking for side hustles to earn more money and ways to save the money they’ve already made. In the last few years, online banks and savings accounts have risen in popularity and offer a fantastic solution to traditional banking. While many people are wary of using asolely online bankand trusting their money to that entity, with research, you can find a great bank that provides better benefits than those of a brick-and-mortar financial institution. Better interest For most people, the greatest appeal of an online bank is that you’ll have a much greater interest rate for your savings account. Since an online bank does not have to worry about the cost of maintaining physical bank locations and hiring hundreds of employees, they’re able to offer a greater interest rate for your money, some as high as 2.0%. This number is incredibly appealing when compared to the average interest rate at a traditional bank, which is around 0.04%. Many people opt to continue to use a traditional bank for their checking account, but put their savings in an online account. Equal security Many are under the false assumption that online banks are simply not safe. However, online banks and traditional banks both have about the same amount of online security risks, since even traditional banks offer online banking. In order to make sure your money isas safe as possible, double check that the online bank you’re considering working with is FDIC insured and take security measures such as only accessing your account from secure WiFi and regularly changing your password. More options While online banks usually do not provide as many options such as various types of checking and savings accounts, loans, or insurance options, there are plenty of banks you can choose from for a savings (or a basic checking) account. Online banks have to compete with one another to offer the best options, interest rates, and security, so you have plenty to choose from. Take your time to do your research and see what institution best meets your financial needs. Convenience Another great perk is the convenience that many online banks offer. Most established online banks have agreements with ATM networks that allow users to access thousands of ATMs without paying a fee. You can also easily manage your money online and make transactions between other financial accounts.

The following tutorial aims to cover SCNLight’s, how to add them and what basic attributes are and what they signify. The following post is based on the following documentation: SCNLight SCNMaterial ARKit creates lighting models from two sources: Default lighting (Standard SceneKit Lighting) SCNLight Objects Therefore, any custom lighting you may want to add to your scene must be composed of one or more ‘SCNLight’ objects. To add SCNLights to the world, you must first create them and then add them to a SCNNode — which will represent it’s position in space. The code looks something like this This light then interacts with you SCNMaterial to create dynamic, real-world lighting. SCNLight’s carry the possibility to be one of many types. These are best demonstrated by thevisual provided by Applebelow. So, in plain english, what do these types mean? Ambient A light that illuminates all objects in the scene from all directions. Directional A light source with a uniform direction and constant intensity. Omni An omnidirectional light, also known as apoint light. Spot A light source that illuminates a cone-shaped area. Here’s sample code as to how to set the type. Cool but how can I change the strength and color? One of two ways to set the “color” of the light is via the color attribute, this takes in any UIColor and can be coded as below The other way that you can set the color of the light is via the temperature attribute, which is more representative of photography lighting and is measured inKelvin. Finally, the way to set how strong the light is is via the intensity attribute. This is measured inlumens. That’s all for now.

https://medium.com/@droidverine/its-magisk-81abd63ea63d?source=tag_archive---------96-----------------------,WHAT IS Magisk?,1. Android Mic Fix :,"Shivraj Patil Follow -- Listen Share You must have heard the term “Magisk” from many android Brainiacs and Still if you don’t know what’s it then my friend you’re in the right place. During the early ages of Android customization, SuperSU was the popular way of gaining root access. Basically, Root access enables one to not only access the system files lying at the so-called “Root” of the OS but also modify them. It’s a magic tool to customize, tweak, tamper the OS of an android device to get the best out of it by acquiring root permissions. Magisk not only grants root access but also has various features like systemless root and different modules. Magisk can be well defined as “A Magic mask to Alter System Sytemlessly. ” Some of the key features and modules are explained below: It’s a feature which allows system modification without notifying the system. Magisk stores modifications in the boot partition instead of modifying the real system files. OS doesn’t detect any tampering and unaware about modifications which makes the Magisk obscure to the system. The “Systemless” method makes it possible. Nowadays many developers useGoogleSafetyNetfeature to detect the System modifications so that some actions can be performed for example apps like Google pay app and Netflix uses it to detect and restrict rooted devices from accessing the app. 1. Android Mic Fix : Fixes “Ok Google” detection problem on various devices Also fixes in call low volume mic issues. 2. App Systemizer : As the name suggests it is used to systemize user-installed apps systemlessly. 3. Debloater : it can be used to un-install system apps which you don’t use. 4. Viper4Android FX : If you want to increase your music listening experience and enhance it then it is the right module for you. It’s basically an equalizer app. 5.
